DA lays extortion and corruption charges against Mduduzi Manana 14 May 2018 Today, DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Women, Terri Stander MP, accompanied by DA Spokesperson on Community Safety in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature, Michele Clarke MPL, and DA Gender Chairperson in Gauteng at City of Johannesburg, Nazley Khan Sharif, laid charges of extortion and corruption against ANC MP, Mduduzi Manana. This follows the release of a voice clip where Manana could be heard trying to extort his former domestic worker, Ms Christine Wiro. Manana clearly abused his privileged position and subjected Ms Wiro to financial pressure to avoid further prosecution. South Africa is beset by gender-based violence and the ANC government appears to be tacitly condoning by retaining people like Manana in influential government positions. Manana belongs in jail and not in Parliament. Taxpayers should not be funding this convicted criminal’s salary. The decision by the South African Police Service and National Prosecuting Authority to continue pursuing the charges against him must be commended and the DA supports the investigation. The ANC should have fired him as MP when he was first of convicted of assault, but turned a blind eye to him breaking his oath of office instead. The DA will fight to ensure that Manana faces the full of might of the law and will continue to hold those who violate the rights of women accountable.
