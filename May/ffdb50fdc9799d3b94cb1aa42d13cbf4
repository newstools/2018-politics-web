KPMG South Africa statement in response to Barclays Africa Group decision 3 May 2018 KPMG South Africa notes the announcement today from Barclays Africa Group that they have withdrawn their recommendation to reappoint the firm as auditors at their forthcoming Annual General Meeting. We are disappointed by, but fully accept, the decision. We are very proud of the work that we have performed for Barclays Africa Group over many years, and of the diligence and professionalism of the team who served them. We have implemented far-reaching changes over the past seven months to all aspects of the firm including governance, quality, and risk management. Work to further underpin the quality of our services and integrity of our professionals continues. We are confident the steps we are taking to change the firm are the right steps to restore trust in KPMG, and we remain resolute in our determination to achieve this goal.
