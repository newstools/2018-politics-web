DA condemns the assault of our councillor by ANC uMfolozi Mayor 7 May 2018 The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu Natal is outraged following an incident yesterday afternoon where a DA Councillor in Mhlathuze was assaulted and strangled by ANC members. This happened when the DA was attending a youth meeting at Hlanganani Community Hall where the hall was confirmed to be used by the DA. When the members arrived at the hall, there were ANC members outside the hall, who shortly thereafter occupied the hall and started chasing our members out. When Councillor Sihle Magubane intervened and showed proof that the venue was booked, chaos ensued and he was violently manhandled and assaulted by a group of ANC members, including uMfolozi Mayor SW Mgenge. We have laid charges (CAS 70/5/2018) at Esikhawini Police Station against ANC Councillor Mgenge and the ANC following this incident. The DA condemns this incident and is concerned by political intolerance that is rearing its ugly head in this province. We would like to put it categorically that the time for no-go areas in this province is long gone, we will continue to occupy space in any hall, in any area, using the legal means to communicate the DA’s message of Total Change for a better life to residents throughout KZN. We will not be shaken or moved by those who are buckling under pressure. Our Councillor suffered physical harm and we wish him well as he recovers from this barbaric attack.
