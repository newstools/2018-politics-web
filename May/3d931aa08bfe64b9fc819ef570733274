SAPS used to transport food for ANC in Ward 85 by-election 23 May 2018 Members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) have been witnessed dropping off food for ANC party agents at the Ward 85 by-election in Johannesburg. The SAPS vehicle, registration number BTK 140 B, handed out these parcels at the Gereformeerde Church voting station in Florida Park. While crime spirals out of control in Gauteng, SAPS officers are being used as a delivery service rather than fighting crime. Yesterday, it was alleged that Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane verbally threatened SAPS officers with physical abuse should they arrest her son who is wanted for abuse. It is apparent that the ANC is abusing its power to use state resources to further their own ends. I will question MEC Nkosi-Malobane about this and ensure that there are consequences for this blatant abuse of power. The ANC cannot do what it pleases and must be held to account for its wrong-doing. Issued by Michele Clarke, DA Gauteng Spokesperson for Community Safety, 23 May 2018
