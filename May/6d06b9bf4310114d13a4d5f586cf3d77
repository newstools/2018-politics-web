NMB Council sees ANC/EFF motions fail to launch The ANC/EFF alliance was defeated today in the Nelson Mandela Bay Council, where their attempted motions of no confidence once again failed to launch. Their alliance of chaos and violence failed to secure enough support to proceed to a vote. They were forced to withdraw these motions, rather than face the embarrassment of losing the vote. The ANC was two councillors down today, as two of their senior members find themselves in jail cells, convicted of serious crimes. This is indicative of the state of the ANC today; a party of criminality from top to bottom. With these frivolous motions behind us, the serious work of bringing change to Nelson Mandela Bay forges ahead under the DA-led coalition government. We have houses to build, roads to tar, toilets to install, jobs to create and an economy to grow – and forces against us will not prevail. The DA considers this ANC/EFF failure to be a victory for the people of Nelson Mandela Bay, who came out in their numbers to vote for change in 2016. The mandate of the people must prevail, and in 2016 the people of NMB voted the ANC out of power decisively. The DA thanks the parties in Council who are standing on the right side of history against the ANC/EFF alliance. Mayor Athol Trollip, and his government, will not be distracted by this frivolous campaign – we have the people’s work to do. Statement issued by Nqaba Bhanga, DA EC Provincial Leader, 10 May 2018
