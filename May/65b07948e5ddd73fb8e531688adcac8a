Eskom must confirm whether Brian Molefe has repaid his “golden handshake” 3 May 2018 The Chairperson of the Eskom Board, Jabu Mabuza, must confirm whether disgraced former Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe, has paid back the part of the “golden handshake” he received from the power utility. On 17 April, Mr Molefe lost an appeal to pay back around R11 million he had received from Eskom as part of his ridiculous R30 million pension pay-out. The court ordered that Mr Molefe pay back the money. The 10-day deadline given by the court has now come and gone. Eskom must now confirm whether he has in fact paid back the money. If not, Eskom must detail what steps they have taken or will be taking to ensure the millions have been recovered from Mr Molefe. In 2016, both the Former Public Enterprises Minister, Lynne Brown and the previous Eskom Board acknowledged Molefe’s resignation. In fact, subsequent to his resignation, he took up another position as an ANC Member of Parliament where he served on the Portfolio Committees on Economic Development and International Relations and Cooperation. Thus, Molefe’s ridiculous assertion that he remained an Eskom employee following his departure from the utility, is simply untrue. All the facts point towards Mr Molefe’s contract with Eskom having ceased and he has no right to such an exorbitant pension pay-out. The court confirmed this. Eskom has a duty to inform the public whether Mr Molefe has returned the millions he was not entitled to receive, and the court ordered him to repay.
