EFF welcomes the judgment by Judge Johnson on Karabo Mokoena's murder 2 May 2018 The EFF welcomes the judgement in the murder case of Karabo Mokoena who was killed through stabbing and her body dumped after being burned beyond recognition. Today, Judge Johnson handed down his judgement and found Sandile Mantsoe, who had been Karabo Mokoena’s lover, guilty of assault, murder and defeating the ends of justice. We welcome this verdict as a step in the right direction towards finding justice for the high levels of femicide facing our country. South African men are at war against women. A woman in our country, including the girl child, lives in permanent fear of sexual assault, rape and brutal murder, often by someone they know intimately. The case of Karabo Mokoena gives confidence that justice can indeed be served. This is a step forward in dealing with violent patriarchal and misogynistic masculinities as many cases never get resolved. As a result, many women have even given up approaching the police about the abusive and violent conditions they live under. A great deal of work still needs to be done to prevent the brutal murder and rape of women and the girl child. We call on society to take inspiration from this judgement and improve on the fight against femicide. Let police follow up on all cases, popular or not. We call on families and all formations to believe reports of women and girl children and above all provide them with all the necessary support. Once more, we send our heartfelt and warm condolences to the family of Karabo Mokoena. May this judgement comfort their broken hearts, though it can never replace their daughter. May Karabo Mokoena’s soul rest in perfect peace. Issued by Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, National Spokesperson, EFF, 2 May 2018
