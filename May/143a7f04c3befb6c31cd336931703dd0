SAPS allowing ANC to abuse state resources 24 May 2018 The ANC in Johannesburg has abused state facilities by holding a meeting with party branding at the Cleveland Police Station, Johannesburg. This was brought to my attention by DA Councillor Neuren Pieterson and DA MPL Jack Bloom. Click here, here, here and here for photos. Police stations are neutral territory and are supposed to be places of safety. ANC Councillor Allison Roberts, who was the keynote speaker at this event, as well as the Station Commander must be brought to book for this incident. Yesterday, at the Ward 85 by-election in Florida Park, a SAPS vehicle was spotted delivering food parcels to ANC activists. Given that the MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane’s attitude that she and the ANC can do as they please with SAPS resources, I will be taking this matter up with Gauteng Premier, David Makhura. SAPS are supposed to be non-partisan and the blatant abuse of their services by ANC office bearers not only abuses public funds, but also detracts from the mandate of SAPS which is to combat crime. The DA will not allow this incident to be swept under the carpet. Issued by Kate Lorimer, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Community Safety, 24 May 2018
