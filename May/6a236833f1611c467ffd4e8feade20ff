Mduduzi Manana: DA to request IPID investigation for possible collusion with SAPS commander 15 May 2018 The DA will write to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) to request that they investigate the Douglasdale South African Police Service (SAPS) station commander and his involvement in the Mduduzi Manana case. In the voice clip that was recorded outside the Douglasdale police station and released in the media, Manana allegedly states: “so the commander is saying if we do that, the statement is convened and then we go sit down for negotiation.” This implies that there might have been some form of collusion between Manana and the station commander to get the charges against him by his domestic worker, Ms Christine Wiro, allegedly pushing her down a flight of stairs and out of his house whilst verbally abusing her, dropped. It is important that this be investigated as it is in no way acceptable that charges of gender-based violence be negotiated. The police cannot negotiate charges laid by victims of gender-based violence who depend on them for protection. They are there to investigate these charges. IPID should therefore act within their mandate and investigate these disturbing utterances and to ensure that justice is upheld. The damning allegations against Manana and his previous assault conviction should see him removed from Parliament, yet he continues to serve as an MP. He belongs behind bars, anything less would be a terrible injustice to women in South Africa. Issued by Terri Stander, DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Women, 15 May 2018
