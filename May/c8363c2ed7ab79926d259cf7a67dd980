ANCWL STATEMENT ON SENTENCING OF ANDILE LUNGISA 9 May 2018 The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) has noted that the ANC councillor in Nelson Mandela Bay Cde Andile Lungisa has been sentenced to two years’ direct imprisonment for  assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  Whilst the ANCWL respect the independence of the Courts and does not support violence against any person, we differ with the logic that Magistrate Morne Cannon used to arrive to his judgment. The Courts of law must be consistent and at all times strive to have legitimacy in the eyes of the general populace so that it can continue to command moral authority. It is suspicious also for the Court to dismiss Lungisa's application for leave to appeal. The ANCWL encourages Lungisa to approach the Supreme Court of Appeals on the matter. Whether real or imagined, the sentence on Lungisa raises suspicions that there are elements of political vengeance against him. Statement issued by Meokgo Matuba, ANCWL Secretary General, 9 May 2018
