EXTENSION OF DEADLINE FOR WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS FOR LAND EXPROPRIATION WITHOUT COMPENSATION The deadline for written submissions on the proposed review of Section 25 of the Constitution has been extended by two weeks until 15 June 2018. This extension will make the period for written submissions a total of 60 days given to the public to make written input on the expropriation of land without compensation. The Joint Constitutional Review Committee met today to adopt its programme for public hearings on the proposed review of Section 25 of the Constitution. The committee was instructed by the National Assembly (NA) and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) to review Section 25 of the Constitution and other clauses where necessary; to make it possible for the state to expropriate land, in the public interest without compensation, and propose constitutional amendments where necessary. In doing so, the committee is expected to engage in a public participation process in order to get views of all stakeholders about the necessity of, and mechanisms for expropriating land without compensation. Written submissions will be processed from 9 – 13 July 2018 and public hearings will be held in all provinces from 27 June – 06 August 2018. Oral Representations will be held in Parliament from 7 – 17 August 2018. The committee will then deliberate on its draft report for adoption by the Committee on 11 September 2018. The committee also resolved to request both the NA and the NCOP to extend its deadline for reporting back to Parliament from31 August to 11 September 2018.
