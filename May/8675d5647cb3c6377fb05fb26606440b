DA clarifies that ‘fake news’ post is not official DA content 7 May 2018 The DA would like to clarify that the ‘De Lille Exposed’ post which has been shared on social media is not official content and has never been shared by our official DA platforms. More importantly, this fake letter has never been used as the basis for any disciplinary matter between Patricia de Lille and the party. It is unfortunate that a fake news post which makes use of the Auditor General’s signature has been shared as authentic content by many who have fallen prey to fake news on social media platforms. The DA has been in contact with News24 to ensure that the reporting on this matter is not ambiguous. The damning findings against Ms De Lille which were presented by the AG to the City of Cape Town as part of his audit opinion are contained on our official website and are accurate. The DA is confident that this now clarifies that all content shared on our official party platforms is accurate and authentic. Issued by Natasha Mazzone, Deputy Chairperson of Federal Council, 7 May 2018
