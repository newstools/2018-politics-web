Auditor-General rates DA-governed Midvaal as best performing municipality in Gauteng 24 May 2018 The Auditor-General (A-G), Kimi Makwetu has rated DA-run Midvaal as the best run municipality in Gauteng and has expressed that other municipalities in the province should follow Midvaal’s lead in good governance. Midvaal is the only municipality in Gauteng to receive a clean audit with no findings against it. This is the third year in a row that the municipality has achieved this status. Under the leadership of Mayor Bongani Baloyi, residents of Midvaal experience high standards of living and receive the services they deserve from government. The cities of Johannesburg and Tshwane have also improved since DA-coalition governments have taken office. As pointed out by the A-G, work is being done in these municipalities to rectify the legacy projects left behind by the ANC which have cost billions of Rands in unauthorised expenditure. The work done by the DA and our coalition partners is starting to bear fruit. People who live in these municipalities are starting to see the DA difference in action. In 2019, residents of Gauteng will be afforded the opportunity to elect a government that will bring these positive changes and professional style of governance to all 13 million of the province’s citizens. I would like to thank our Mayors, our coalition partners and every public servant who has committed to bringing change to the people whom they serve.
