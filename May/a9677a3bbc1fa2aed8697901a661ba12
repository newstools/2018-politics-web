Apartheid was indeed a crime against humanity 21 May 2018 The apartheid philosophy was that black South Africans were not equally  human as their white counterparts. The United Nations guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reports about how black South Africans were treated by the apartheid regime concluded that apartheid was indeed a crime against humanity. Many black and white South Africans opposed apartheid for the same reasons. The apartheid regime  beat up, arrested, charged and sentenced black and white South Africans who opposed apartheid. Many died opposing apartheid in South Africa The Congress of the People (COPE) rejects with contempt the AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel's recent comments  and we urge him to withdraw the statement and never again teach South Africans, black and white, that apartheid was not a crime against humanity. End! Issued by the President of the Congress of the People, Mosiuoa Lekota. 21 May 2018
