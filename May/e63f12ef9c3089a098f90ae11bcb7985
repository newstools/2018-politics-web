ANC sits idle while Gauteng rural murders are on the rise 14 May 2018 The horrific murder of Fanie and Colleen Engelbrecht on their farm, Welgevonden, Westonaria, and another attack on another couple in Westonaria, are sad tales of the escalating attacks on people living and working on farms and small holdings in Gauteng. The DA has repeatedly called on the ANC-led provincial government to prioritise the redeployment of specialised rural safety units. This plea has fallen on deaf ears and residents living in peripheral areas remain vulnerable to attack. This year’s crime statistics has shown that Gauteng is the murder capital of South Africa and that attacks on residents frequently take place in their homes. Gauteng is home to many farming communities, yet the ANC stick their heads in the sand about the safety of farmworkers and farmers. The DA will continue to stand up for these communities and push this administration to re-introduce the deployment of rural safety units as well as an increase in personnel to ensure the safety of these residents.
