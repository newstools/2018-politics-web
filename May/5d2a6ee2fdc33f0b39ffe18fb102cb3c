ANC STATEMENT ON THE BRUTAL AND COWARDLY MURDER OF ROSALIE BLOCH AND AUBREY JACKSON 5 May 2018 The African National Congress is saddened to learn of the brutal, callous and cold-blooded killing of comrade Graeme Bloch’s parents, Rosalie Bloch 84 and Aubrey Jackson 96, who were found murdered in their Rosebank home in Cape Town today. The ANC is dismayed and shocked at this evil deed. We strongly condemn the cowardly act visited on the defenceless and elderly. It is disheartening to note that we still have amongst us, those who are determined to trample on other people’s right to live driven by selfish and cruel intentions. These are elements that must be isolated and locked away to rid our society of heartless criminals. Law enforcement agencies must indeed leave no stone unturned in their quest to ensure that perpetrators of this heinous crime are caught and face the full might of the law. We further call on all South Africans to act in concert to ensure that criminals have nowhere to hide wherever they seek refuge. We express our sincere condolences to comrades Graeme Bloch, his wife and fellow activist Cde Cheryl Carolus and the Bloch family on their untimely loss. The ANC wishes Rosalie Bloch and Aubrey Jackson eternal peace. Issued on behalf of the ANC National Executive Committee Statement issued by Pule Mabe, ANC National Spokesperson, 5 May 2018
