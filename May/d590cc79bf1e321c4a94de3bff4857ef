EFF CALLS ON RAMAPHOSA TO BE HONEST ON DD MABUZA’S VISIT TO RUSSIA Thursday, May 24, 2018 The EFF calls on President Ramaphosa, to be honest about Deputy President DD Mabuza’s visit to Russia. It has been two weeks since it was reported that he is on an envoy, yet there are allegations that Mabuza is actually not on a state visit, but in hospital. Ramaphosa ought to be honest to the nation because there is no report or even pictures of Mabuza’s visit. It is both a constitutional and a moral obligation for the public to know. This basic moral sense would be obvious to any man with a conscience, presiding over the highest office in the land. Mabuza is in Russia, on taxpayers’ money, yet we have no report on what the envoy is about and what has it been up to over the last two weeks. Clearly, Ramaphosa sees no reason to be accountable the same way Zuma was. He sees no reason to update the South African public on its Deputy President and why he would be away from the country for two weeks, yet getting paid and protected through public resources. The EFF calls on the immediate release of information of why is Mabuza is in Russia and what are the purposes thereof. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 24 May 2018
