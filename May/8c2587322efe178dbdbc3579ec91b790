COSATU calls on government Â to do more to take of the homeless and he poor during this cold front 14 May 2018 The Congress of South African Trade Unions calls on government at all levels to open emergency shelters and provide adequate resources to the most vulnerable in our society during the cold front and severe weather that has hit many parts of the country. The federation is concerned that many homeless people and poor families are left exposed to the elements during the winter period. This leads to them having to use dirty energy to try and stave off the cold during this period. We are concerned by the number of shack fires during the winter months all across the country and we hope that emergency services across the country will prepare for such eventualities this year. We call on municipalities across the country to adopt a commonsense approach to provide for the poor during this cold snap and extreme weather. We also encourage our business and our members to donate and contribute amenities like sleeping bags to homeless shelters and civil society organisations that take care of the most vulnerable people in our society.
