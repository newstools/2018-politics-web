UNSAFE LIFTS AT STEVE BIKO HOSPITAL Staff and patients who use the lifts at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria are at risk as they contravene the Occupational Health and Safety Act. This is disclosed by Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. I am not surprised by this information as I often get complaints about broken lifts at this hospital which forces sick patients to walk up stairs and can even delay surgery as patients on trolleys can’t get transported to another floor. In September last year all but one of the 28 lifts at the hospital were broken, causing great inconvenience. Ramokgopa says, however, that the hospital building is “in general good physical state” although 150 minor infrastructure faults are currently logged which “should be attended to within the 24 hours or 7 days time frame.” I am disappointed that the lifts at this major hospital continue to give problems. The fault lies with the dysfunctional Department of Infrastructure Development which is incapable of doing even simple things like keeping lifts safe and working. Hospital management should be put in charge of all maintenance as I am sure they will do a better job. Statement by Jack Bloom MPL, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 25 January 2018
