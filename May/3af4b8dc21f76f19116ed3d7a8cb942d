Makhura again failing to hold his ANC leaders to account 23 May 2018 My mandate as the political head of the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng includes being responsible, and indeed accountable, for the actions of all DA public representatives in the province. I would hang my head in shame if it emerged that one of my public representatives, such is the case with former MMC for Housing, Cllr Dan Bovu, was not only accused of corruption, but was allegedly found to have tampered with witnesses in the court-case relating to these very allegations; an affidavit to this effect is in Mayor Herman Mashaba’s possession. Yet, this seems to be business as usual for Premier Makhura and his ANC in the province. Cllr Bovu stands accused of using his office for the illegal sale of City-owned properties, despite thousands of the province’s residents desperately awaiting houses. Whilst charges against Cllr Bovu were temporarily withdrawn on Friday last week due to the non-appearance of key witnesses in this case, it has subsequently emerged that the witnesses were in fact paid off to ensure that they did not present their evidence against Cllr Bovu in court. This is a clear indication that the rot pervasive in the ANC, has infected every office in the province. Premier Makhura, as the figurehead of the ANC in Gauteng, stands by, while this rot robs our people of their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives. The Life Esidimeni tragedy is a symptom of a far larger ethical and moral failure in the Premier’s provincial government. Leaders lead by example, and Makhura, in failing to hold himself ultimately responsible for the death of 144 people, has taught his public representatives how to evade duty, accountability, and even the law. Come 2019, we will bring much needed change to Gauteng, and ensure all our residents are put first. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 23 May 2018
