AfriForum creates fund to support farm attack victims 24 May 2018 The civil rights watchdog AfriForum today announced that it had created a fund to offer specifically financial help to farm attack victims. “We should do all in our power to ensure that their human dignity is intact; we have to remember and tell every farm attack victim’s story,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety. Cameron says that people do not always realise what the impact of a farm attack has on those who are affected by it. “It is not only traumatic, but also robs people of an integral part of their human dignity. Many victims are already destitute and have no other refuge as the place where they were attacked – they are therefore continuously confronted with the scene of their worst nightmare,” Cameron says. AfriForum’s 911 trauma unit does not only provide food to destitute victims, but also helps with basic medical challenges, clothes, support in court, the taking down of statements and, in some cases, the necessary psychological support. AfriForum also helps to ensure that the house in which the attack occurred is cleaned with the correct chemicals in cooperation with Crime Scene Clean Up. If you would like to get involved with this unit, send an email to trauma@afriforum.co.za. Donations to the fund can be deposited into the following bank account: Account name:           AfriForum NPC Account number:        62349898398 Branch:                       Centurion Branch code:              261-550 Issued by Ian Cameron, Head: Community Safety, AfriForum, 24 May 2018
