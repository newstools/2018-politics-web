DA welcomes commission of inquiry into SARS 23 May 2018 The DA welcomes the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint a Commission of Inquiry into the South African Revenue Service (SARS), to be headed by Judge Robert Nugent with the assistance of Michael Katz, Mabongi Masilo and Vuyo Kahla. SARS, under the disastrous tenure of ex-Commissioner Tom Moyane, had degenerated from a world class tax collection agency into a 'captured' institution beholden to Jacob Zuma and his band of corrupt cadres. Moyane not only acted at variance with his responsibilities as SARS Commissioner, but also: - Failed to act against taxpayers who were connected to the Jacob Zuma contingent; - Consciously failed to ensure full and proper disciplinary processes against certain connected and senior SARS members, such as Jonas Makwakwa; - Manipulated tax revenue figures; - Caused enormous damage to the economy and the loss of jobs by delaying the refunds of taxes; and - Played a predominant role in the revenue shortfall of R 50 billion in 2017/18 The DA urges the Commission of Inquiry to start its work without delay and to work swiftly and diligently to ensure that it produces a comprehensive and productive report. The DA will monitor the progress of the Commission and will cooperate with it in order to ensure that swift progress can be made. The appointment of the Commission, soon after Mark Kingon’s elevation to acting Commissioner, are essential steps towards the restoration of sanity at the tax revenue service.
