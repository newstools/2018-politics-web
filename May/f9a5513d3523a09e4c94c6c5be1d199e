Resignation (early retirement) may not save North West premier from being prosecuted 23 May 2018 The legacy of Mr Supra Mahumapelo as Premier of the North West province includes violent protests, mismanagement, political infighting, instability, irregularities, Gupta links, numerous allegations of corruption and the collapse of the provincial Department of Health. The FF Plus welcomes the resignation (early retirement) of Mahumapelo but will not allow the allegations implicating him in extensive fraud and corruption to come to nothing. These allegations must be thoroughly investigated. The premier’s resignation must not save him from being prosecuted. Earlier this month, the FF Plus lodged a complaint with the Public Protector (PP) and requested that the allegations of extensive fraud and corruption that implicate Mahumapelo be investigated. The allegations are, among other things, that businesses owned by Mahumapelo were supposedly funded by implementing agents that were contracted by the province. Recently, the North West suffered irreparable economic and financial damage due to violent protests that were accompanied by the malicious damage of property. The ANC’s infighting was the direct cause of these violent riots. Once again, the ANC has proven itself incapable of governing a country seeing as its infighting and megalomania has caused great damage.
