THREATS TO CLOSE JOBURG HOSPITAL I am extremely concerned by threats that the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital will be closed by striking workers this Wednesday. Staff and patients have told me that these threats have been widely publicized in the hospital and are causing anxiety. This follows the trashing of the hospital last week by disgruntled workers and some outsiders who joined them. The protesters included general workers, porters and some nurses, including members of the National Education and Health And Workers’ Union (Nehawu). The cause appears to be grievances over non-payment of overtime and performance bonuses. The Gauteng Health Department needs to effectively enforce the court interdict it has obtained against the striking workers. Further disruption of this major hospital will have a horrendous effect on the welfare of patients. Every effort should be made to maintain health services and resolve worker grievances peacefully and speedily. Statement issued by Jack Bloom MPL, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 1 May 2018
