ANCWL statement on Mduduzi Manana 8 May 2018 The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) has noted the reports that that a 53-year-old women who opened a case of assault, crimen injuria and intimidation against African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) member Mduduzi Manana has withdrawn the charges on the same evening of opening the case at Douglasdale Police Station. Whilst we take into account the principles of innocent until proven guilty, the ANCWL is resolute in supporting the victims of violence and wishes to reiterate this position. ANCWL acknowledges that there are various reasons for victims of gender based violence to withdraw cases but however that practice defeats the goal of eliminating gender based violence in the country.  We call all members of society to unite and provide support to the victims of gender based violence. Withdrawal of  cases of gender based violence has a potential to delegitimise the fight against abuse of women. The ANCWL condemns violence against women and encourages all victims to report cases to law enforcement agencies and allow the law to take its course.
