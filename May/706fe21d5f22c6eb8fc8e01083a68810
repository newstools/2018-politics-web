Ambassador recall is outrageous and displays gross double-standards The South African Government’s decision to withdraw the South African Ambassador from Israel is outrageous and displays gross double-standards against the Jewish state.   While we, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies and the SA Zionist Federation, regret the loss of life of civilians, we recognise that Israel as a sovereign state has the right to defend its own border and its own citizens.  Israel is facing a real danger with the incitement by Hamas of its own population to storm the security fence and attack Israeli civilians. By withdrawing its Ambassador, South Africa is essentially walking away from playing any meaningful role in finding a sorely needed resolution to the conflict.  The rhetoric used by the government has already has spilled into antisemitic comment on various social media platforms and the biggest losers are the South African Jewish community, and other peace loving South Africans.  This is a victory only for extremism in the Middle East.  We call on the South African Government to reconsider its decision immediately.
