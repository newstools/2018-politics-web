Molefe petitions Supreme Court of Appeal – Solidarity 15 May 2018 Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe petitioned against the judgment of a full bench of the Northern Gauteng High Court that his pension pay-out had been unlawful. This petition was submitted to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein today. According to Solidarity COO Dirk Hermann, the trade union has already instructed its legal team to oppose the petition. “We are extremely disappointed in Mr Molefe’s decision to petition the court. He unlawfully received tax payers’ money. With this decision he once again failed a character test,” Hermann said. According to Hermann, Molefe is abusing the judiciary in a bid not to repay the money he received fraudulently. “A culture whereby high-ranking persons are using the courts to escape accountability is developing in South Africa,” Hermann said. “We will definitely oppose the petition and ask for a further cost order against him,” Hermann added. The Northern Gauteng High Court earlier denied with costs Molefe’s application for leave to appeal after the court’s initial finding that the pension pay-outs to Molefe were unlawful and that he had to repay the money he had already received.
