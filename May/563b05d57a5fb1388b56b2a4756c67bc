AfriForum intensifies its campaign against expropriation without compensation after ANC announcement 22 May 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum today announced that it will intensify its campaign, both within South Africa and abroad, against expropriation without compensation. This follows the ANC’s announcement yesterday, 21 May, that they will attempt to implement expropriation without compensation within the framework of Section 25 of the Constitution, while the process to amend Section 25 of the Constitution continues. Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum, says that AfriForum plans to make verbal presentations to Parliament and to take part in the various public participation processes. The organisation also intends to meet with the investment envoys, which President Cyril Ramaphosa recently appointed with the aim of attracting foreign investors. AfriForum is also spearheading a petition in this regard and protest action is presently under consideration. “AfriForum will continue with its international campaign; liaison tours to Europe and Australia and a follow-up tour to the USA will also be organised. More information about this will be announced soon,” says Roets. Ronald Lamola, member of the ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC), recently also confirmed that the ANC not only intends to expropriate rural land, but urban land as well. Roets says that property rights are the cornerstones of economic development and that the ANC’s acceleration of expropriation without compensation boils down to an acceleration of economic deterioration, as it were.
