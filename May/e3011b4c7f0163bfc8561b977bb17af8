Man dies at Bara hospital after attack by psychiatric patient 14 May 2018 I am horrified by the report today that a man was attacked and killed at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital allegedly by a psychiatric patient. According to the report, Mr Piet Ntsanwisi (59) died from head injuries on Saturdaymorning after he was assaulted with a steel drip-stand. Ntsanwisi’s family say that the hospital was negligent as a mentally ill patient went on a rampage, smashing windows and breaking things as staff failed to restrain him. This terrible incident needs to be investigated and urgent measures taken to tighten the security for mental patients. Patients and staff have also been attacked by psychiatric patients in other Gauteng hospitals, which highlights the continuing inadequacies of treatment facilities for mental patients even after the Esidimeni tragedy. I will communicate with the Health Ombudsman to investigate the continuing poor treatment of mental health patients in Gauteng. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 14 May 2018
