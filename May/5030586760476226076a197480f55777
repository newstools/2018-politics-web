KZN MEC must fast-track probe into threats and intimidation of A-G staff 28 May 2018 The Democratic Alliance calls on KZN CoGTA MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, to fast-track a probe into allegations of death threats and intimidation against staff from the Auditor-General’s (A-G) office who were last week auditing eThekwini Municipality. The move comes after fresh claims that audit managers at Msunduzi Municipality have also faced intimidation. The DA regards these claims as extremely serious. They show just how far some officials are prepared to go to protect their own backs. Their alleged conduct is also in breach of the law and makes a mockery of the process of accountability in terms of Chapter 9 institutions. It is critical that the A-G’s office be allowed to continue its audits without interference of any kind. Within eThekwini there are compliance issues which points directly to the disregard of Supply Chain Management procedures. Meanwhile, Msunduzi Municipality is on the verge of collapse as a result of poor financial management. The DA expects the MEC to prioritize this investigation in the interests of the people of our province. They deserve fully functional municipalities that deliver proper services to all communities.
