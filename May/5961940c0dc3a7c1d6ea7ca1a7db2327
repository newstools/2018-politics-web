Burning tyres at Joburg Hospital 31 May 2018 Protesting workers at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital burnt tyres and blocked entrances yesterday, causing fear and disruption for patients and staff. A nurse described to me how she feared for her safety when she couldn’t drive her car out at 1pm because of a burning tire and aggressive protestors. The workers’ grievances are about unpaid performance bonuses and the current wage negotiations. I am highly concerned that disruption continues at this hospital which was violently trashed a month ago. Leratong hospital on the West Rand has also been affected by workers who have blockaded the hospital, causing the cancellation of all non-emergency surgery. The Gauteng Health Department needs to settle worker grievances speedily and fairly, but disruption of hospitals should not be tolerated as they provide an essential service.
