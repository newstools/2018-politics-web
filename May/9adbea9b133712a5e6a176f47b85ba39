DA retains Ward 10 and grows to 94% 31 May 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has emerged victorious in a highly contested by-election in Ward 10 in Kloof. The DA increased its share of votes from  91.13% in 2016 to 94.23%. The ANC’s support dwindled from 6.5% in 2016 to 5.10%. The writing is on the wall for the ANC in KZN as it is becoming clear that people are voting for change, while rejecting corruption, maladministration, looting and political infighting in this province. The era of people being taken for granted in this province is coming to an end. The DA is ready to make sure that people are prioritized and quality services are delivered to them. The DA’s victory is a clear sign that now more than ever, people in this city and the province have faith in the DA as the only party that can bring Change and quality services, jobs, and ensure that citizens are safe. This by-election follows two others in the province where the DA has grown exponentially in areas where the ANC dominated. In Mkhambathini the DA won a voting district from the ANC for the first time in history. Last week in Mtubatuba the DA also increased its percentage in voting districts where we previously had no footprint, proving once again that we are growing everywhere in KZN. As we head to 2019, we are committed more than ever to change the lives of the people for the better. We urge citizens to come on board with us to make this province work by choosing the DA.
