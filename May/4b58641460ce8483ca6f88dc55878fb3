THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS WELCOMES THE SELFLESS GESTURE DISPLAYED BY PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA The African National Congress welcomes the philanthropic and selfless gesture undertaken by the President of the ANC and our country, Cde Cyril Ramaphosa, to donate half his salary to the Nelson Mandela Foundation. This is a clear and tangible indication of the seriousness with which the ANC views it's commitment to the recently launched Thuma Mina campaign that is underpinned on being of service to others and its solutions driven objectives. This will go a long way in decreasing the burden of poverty, experienced by the downtrodden and offers some respite on inequalities brought about by unemployment. The African National Congress calls on its leaders to ensure that the Thuma Mina Campaign continues to find expression in the organisation by following the example laid down by the President and follow suit.
