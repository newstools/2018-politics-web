DA's unfair process forced me to seek relief from the courts, says Patricia de Lille 8 May 2018 Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says the Democratic Alliance has forced her to seek relief from the courts. This after the party confirmed the cessation of her membership of the DA on Tuesday morning, after charging the embattled mayor with misconduct earlier this year. The DA cited clause 3.5.1.2 in its constitution, which says if a member publicly declares his or her intention to resign, then their membership ceases immediately. De Lille reportedly said during a radio interview on April 26 that she would "walk away from the party" once she had cleared her name, as the "the writing's on the wall" that people didn't want her to be there. De Lille told journalists on Tuesday that the "cessation clause" was unconstitutional and unfairly applied to her. "Despite this mockery of fairness and justice, the thousands of supporters from all over the country have sent so many messages of support over the eight months that I've endured this relentless onslaught by these bullies against me," said De Lille. She denied that she stonewalled the DA process against her. "I'm not stonewalling this process, I'm very sorry," De Lille said. De Lille said that she was committed to the people of the city. "I'm ready to continue to fight... it's because of the City of Cape Town, it's because of them I am ready to fight. I have made a commitment to serve the people of the City of Cape Town, and I have continued to do so." News24
