DA files papers to have Arthur Fraser’s appointment set aside The DA has filed papers with the Pretoria High Court to have President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appointment of Arthur Fraser as National Commissioner of Correctional Services set aside with immediate effect. Fraser is a deeply compromised individual who is not unfit to hold such a vital position within government, and the DA argues that the President failed in his constitutional obligations by appointing him. The serious allegations against Fraser include that he operated a secret and parallel intelligence service from his own home while working for the State Security Agency (SSA) and utilised millions of rands of public funds for personal gain. Our legal action seeks an order declaring that the President’s recent appointment of Arthur Fraser violated the President’s constitutional obligation to appoint a National Commissioner who is sufficiently conscientious, has enough credibility to do this important job effectively and is of good character. The Department of Correctional Services has struggled for some time to function efficiently or effectively. Under Commissioner Modise, it made steady progress towards clamping down on corruption, improving its IT systems and getting better financial control. Under Mr Fraser, this improvement will likely be reversed. The Courts, including the Constitutional Court, found that Adv Simelane’s appointment as National Director of Public Prosecutions was irrational since adverse findings had been made against him in the Ginwala Commission. If that was the case, how much more so must Mr Fraser’s appointment be irrational? We, therefore, ask that the court review and set aside the President’s decision to appoint Arthur Fraser as National Commissioner of Correctional Services on 17 April 2018.
