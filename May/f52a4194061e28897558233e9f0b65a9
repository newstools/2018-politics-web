National bus strike: DA calls for speedy resolution to wage negotiations as strike enters day 20 7 May 2018 Transport Minister, Blade Nzimande, must show leadership and help bring the bus strike to an end as trade unions and employers in the bus industry meet to discuss wages today. The bus strike is now in its 20th day and has affected tens of thousands of commuters across the country, many of whom have missed work and school. It is vital that employers and employees in the sector reach a resolution soon. We acknowledge the new wage offer by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and bargaining council of an increase of 8.75% for the first year and 8.25% for the second and we encourage both parties to come to an agreement for the benefit of all. The country cannot afford another breakdown in wage negotiations as commuters have had to go out of their way to find alternative transport and, in some cases, spend more on it. While it is important that the concerns of employees and employers in the bus sector are heard, commuters must not be made to suffer any longer.
