DA’s proposal for a moratorium on official spousal travel is being considered by the Presidency 28 May 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa has confirmed [see here] that the review of the size and shape of the national executive has begun, but that it will only be implemented after Election 2019. The reshaping of the national executive will take time but is a lost opportunity to send the right “fiscal signals” when it comes to wasteful expenditure by the national executive. There are a number of “quick wins” that could be implemented immediately that would send the right “fiscal signals” and would compliment the review of the size and shape of the national executive. That is why I wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa, on 04 May 2018, proposing that he consider: Placing a moratorium on members of the executive being accompanied on international official journeys by spouses and/or adult family members; and Ordering a review of the sections dealing with international official journeys for spouses and adult family members in the Ministerial Handbook: Handbook for Members of the Executive and Presiding Officers. This followed revelations that R873 366.68 was blown on international travel for the former Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba’, wife who accompanied him on investor roadshows to the financial capitals of the world inter alia in China, the United Kingdom and the United States. It’s staggering that the minister who increased Value Added Tax blew nearly R870 000+ on what were in reality a series of intercontinental shopping trips for his wife in the financial capitals of the world. We, therefore, welcome the letter [see here], dated 17 May 2015, from Dr Cassius Lubisi, the Director General and Cabinet Secretary, which confirms that the “matter is receiving attention”. We hope that President Cyril Ramaphosa will not wait for the implementation of the review of the size and shape of the national executive to take decisive action to clamp doewn on wasteful expenditure by the national executive by inter alia: Placing a moratorium on international official journeys of executive members  spouses and/or adult family members; and Ordering a review of the relevant sections of the Ministerial Handbook: Handbook for Members of the Executive and Presiding Officers.
