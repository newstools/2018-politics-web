DA welcomes Presidency’s decision to abide by Courts ruling on Zuma legal fees The DA welcomes the decision by the Presidency and the State Attorney to abide by the Court’s decision on whether Mr Zuma should be held personally liable for these fees or not. In March, we filed papers with the North Gauteng High Court, requesting that an agreement between Mr Zuma and the state to pay his costs be set aside, as we have long held that the state should never have agreed to foot the bill for Mr Zuma’s legal fees. The charges against Zuma related to alleged crimes committed by Mr Zuma in his private capacity and not in his capacity as MEC, Deputy President or President of the Republic. We now hope that the legal proceedings against Mr Zuma will finally go ahead without any further unnecessary delays.  The resolution of this case will speed up the resumption of the criminal case. Public coffers should not be bled dry to cover the legal fees of one man’s actions, these commitments by the Presidency are a victory for democracy and accountability.
