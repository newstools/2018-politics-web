KZN Killings: Actions speak louder than words, President Ramaphosa 15 May 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes President Cyril Ramaphosa’s visit to KwaZulu Natal after the latest two murders in the province of ANC official, Musawenkosi Mchunu and the IFP’s Sibuyiselo Dhlamini. As the DA we have made numerous calls for political killings in the province to be made a priority law enforcement authorities. At the root cause of this is a well-orchestrated campaign within the ANC to rid the party of those that may be opposed to certain factions and those wanting to expose and root out corruption. This is something that the ANC has never denied or opposed. While President Ramaphosa may publicly say that he “will not allow KZN to be the killing fields of South Africa”, the fact of the matter is that hollow words will not bring back the 80 people that have died over the last few years because of ANC political hits. It is now a fact that KZN is the killing field of South Africa. From the testimony before the Moerane Commission, it appears that information exists within the ANC of who those assassins are and their motives. We are reliably aware that police are unable or unwilling to make arrests for a single killing in the province because the perpetrators are politically connected. What KZN so desperately needs is for President Ramaphosa to get a grip on his party and ensure that these killings end once and for all. It is high time that the various civilian intelligence structures start doing their work by picking up signals of the planned assassins and prevent them. Anything short of this will see President Ramaphosa again be a spectator to these deaths as he has been until his election as ANC President. Issued by Zwakele Mncwango, DA KZN Leader, 15 May 2018
