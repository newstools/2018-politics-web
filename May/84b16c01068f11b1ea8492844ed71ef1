Maluti TVET main campus burned down by protesting students  Protesting students of Maluti TVET Colleges caused damage estimated at R15 million when they set fire to the Central Office and five vehicles of the College in Bethlehem on Friday 18 May 2018. The continued administrative delays in NSFAS payments have been cited as one of the major reasons for the protests. While the DA cannot condone vandalism and violence, the students’ frustration with NSFAS’s continued failure is causing anger and frustration. Students depend on NSFAS payments and the fact that NFAS has failed to sort the payments to students is deeply concerning. NSFAS also failed in its communication as to which students have been approved for funding this year. Colleges are cash-strapped and generally can only advance limited financial support to the students from its own reserves. TVET colleges are vital as they are the only option for thousands of thousands of learners to receive training in the skills needed for the job market. NSFAS also emphasises TVETs, with many students who are turned down for university funding being encouraged to apply for TVETs. Yet, if NSFAS cannot deliver on their payments commitments, how do they expect students to be able to get an education and therefore a job? Since March this year the classes at the Maluti TVET college campuses have been facing multiple interruptions from protesting students. It is high time that the new Minister of Higher Education, Naledi Pandor, puts her money where her mouth is and ensures that NSFAS can effectively and efficiently disburse the payments they have committed to.
