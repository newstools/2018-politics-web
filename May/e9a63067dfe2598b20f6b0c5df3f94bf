New Hawks head a 'good and considerate choice' 24 May 2018 The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, welcomes the appointment of General Godfrey Lebeya as the new head of the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks). “General Lebeya is a good and considerate choice. We believe he has the necessary qualifications and experience to lead the Hawks in a new era, where corruption-busting will be the number one priority,” Mr Beukman said. Mr Beukman further emphasised that General Lebeya has previously served the South African Police Service (Saps) with distinction and has the police credentials to make a success of his new appointment. The committee believes that the new Hawks head will have to refocus the unit on transnational crime, the organised drug and illegal fire-arms trade, and crime syndicates in the economic sector. Mr Beukman said that the amendment of the current Saps Act is now critical, because the Hawks should have a separate Budget Vote to strengthen its independence and effectiveness. He also praised the good work done by the Acting Head, General Yoliswa Matakata, during the past 18 months. “We wish her well and trust that she will continue to contribute in the law-enforcement community,” Mr Beukman concluded.
