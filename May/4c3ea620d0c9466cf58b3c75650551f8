Gauteng government to seek justice for two-month-old rape victim 7 May 2018 The Gauteng social development department says it will pursue the person who raped a two-month-old baby after the infant's mother recently received a life sentence for shielding the rapist from authorities. Last month, the 29-year-old woman was sentenced in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg, despite the actual perpetrator not yet being identified.Â Social development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza is expected to brief media on Monday on their plans to approach the criminal justice system to "pursue justice" for the South African born Mozambican baby. The department said it last week brought the baby from Mozambique and placed her in protective custody through a court order. At the time the baby's mother was sentenced, police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the life term would set a precedent to help prevent any person from shielding criminals in future. In November last year, a doctor at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto informed police that the severely injured baby had been admitted. When initially interviewed by officers, the Meadowlands mother claimed that the baby had fallen from a bed. Naidoo said medical tests revealed the baby had been raped.The mother was arrested and charged with aiding and abetting, in terms of the Child Protection Act, child abuse and defeating the ends of justice.Mayathula-Khoza will on Monday also unveil violence awareness campaigns paying attention to femicide.
