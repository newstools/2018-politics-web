DA calls for MEC Lesufi to investigate the use of corporal punishment at Masakhane Primary School 3 May 2018 The DA calls on the Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi to urgently investigate the use of corporal punishment at Masakhane Primary School in Zandspruit, Johannesburg. It is alleged that a young female learner was beaten by the teacher on the arm and was left with severe bruising. See photos here and here. We have been reliably informed that this is the second incident of corporal punishment at the school. The DA strongly condemns the use of corporal punishment in schools. We urge teachers to refrain from hitting students as it is illegal. No one is above the law and we will not allow teachers to disregard the law against corporal punishment and use it as a form of disciplining learners. MEC Lesufi must investigate these two incidents and take stern measures against those teachers implicated. Corporal punishment has no place in our schools.
