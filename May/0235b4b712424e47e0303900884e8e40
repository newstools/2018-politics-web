Appointment of a Mayoral Committee delayed until Monday 14 May 2018 I am required by statute to appoint a Mayoral Committee (Mayco) to assist me in the governance of the City, and I am ready to do so. As is known, last week Alderman Patricia de Lille applied urgently to the High Court in Cape Town for an interim order reinstating her membership of the DA and as Executive Mayor pending the determination of an application by her for final relief against the DA (which is to be heard on 25 May). At the completion of proceedings on Friday evening in the urgent application, the Court reserved judgment and indicated that it was not in a position to indicate when its ruling would be delivered. I am advised that, legally, nothing precludes me from proceeding with the appointment of a Mayco, but out of respect to the Court I will delay making the appointment until 3pm on Monday 14 May 2018. If by then, the High Court has not ruled on Alderman De Lille's application, upholding her application for the interim order, I will proceed with the appointment of a new Mayco. I will not be able to wait any longer than that because without a Mayco from early in the coming week the governance of the City will be compromised. Amongst other things, a Mayco is required to give political guidance to the budget process, which is far advanced, for the forthcoming municipal financial year. I will convene a Mayco meeting for Tuesday morning. Statement issued by Acting Executive Mayor, Ian Neilson, 13 May 2018
