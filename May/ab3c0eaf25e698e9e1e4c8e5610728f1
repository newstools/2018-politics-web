City working to address spate of land invasions in Vrygrond and Parkwood 28 May 2018 I’m deeply disturbed by the spate of land invasions which at times has been accompanied by violence and destruction of property around Cape Town. I also want to place it on record that the City of Cape Town will not tolerate land invasions in the city and law enforcement agencies will not hesitate to act against those who incite violence. Land invasions are illegal and pose fire, health and flood risks to our communities. The seriousness of the matter requires all of us to pull together to find solutions that will be beneficial to residents. In this regard, I am embarking on a series of discussions with the affected communities. Tomorrow I have a scheduled meeting with the residents of Vrygrond in my office to discuss possible proposals. We are waiting for the leadership forum to confirm their attendance. This will be our fourth meeting with the residents. I have also delegated Executive Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson to hold discussions with representatives of Parkwood. Over the last few months, our intervention has resulted in a lull in violence related to land invasions in Gugulethu and Philippi. We are continuing engagements with all communities and it is important for residents to ensure that land earmarked for development is protected from land invaders. We are not able to provide services such as water, electricity, roads and other infrastructure when land is invaded. I am appealing to all communities to work with the City in a peaceful manner so that we can make progress possible together.
