MEC Nkosi-Malobane not above the law 22 May 2018 The DA is shocked to learn that the Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has been accused of interfering with the work of the police and threatening a police officer to not arrest her son. It is alleged that Williams Okpara Junior (25) opened a case of common assault and intimidation against the MEC’s son and his ex-girlfriend. The female police officer investigating the case, who went to arrest the MEC’s son, was allegedly threatened with physical violence by the MEC if her son was arrested. It has also been alleged that the MEC insulted the police officer. This is shameful and disgusting behaviour displayed by the MEC who is a political leader in this Department. It is ironic that the MEC whose mandate it is to ensure that perpetrators of crimes are brought to book is now preventing this from happening. The DA strongly condemns the alleged abuse of power by the MEC for her own personal gain. This cannot be tolerated as no one is above the law. We demand that the Gauteng Premier, David Makhura urgently investigate these serious allegations. If the MEC is found guilty of abusing her power, she must be held accountable.
