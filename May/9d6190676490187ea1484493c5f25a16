Cash in transit heist emphasise need for independent specialist units 23 May 2018 According to Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Safety, there have been more than 135 cash in transit heist in South Africa since the start of 2018. Gauteng was affected the worst. AfriForum is therefore of the opinion that independent specialist units must be established to curb this crime. “It is truly concerning that police members are arrested and prosecuted in various cash in transit heists. A specialist unit is therefore the only way to ensure that this type of crime is eradicated. Political interference from ANC ranks further influences the poor quality of certain officers in the police service,” says Cameron. According to Cameron, this issue cannot only be placed before the doorstep of the police – the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is also at fault. “Cash in transit robbers are professional criminals; they know exactly what they are doing and are trained. They must therefore be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.” Issued by Natasha Venter, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 23 May 2018
