DA concerned about allegations of sexual harassment at Equal Education 24 May 2018 The DA is calling on Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi to launch a probe into the impact of alleged sexual harassment claims against Equal Education (EE) on Gauteng schools and if any Gauteng learners were affected. The DA further calls on the MEC to audit all NGOs working in Gauteng schools to ensure that they vet all employees and ensure they do not hire anyone accused of sexual harassment and are sensitized to working with young and impressionable children. Last week allegations of sexual harassment surfaced against three employees of EE of which one has since resigned. If the allegations prove to be true, we appeal to the MEC to suspend EE’s work in Gauteng schools. These allegations are serious as EE does a lot of work with young impressionable school children and we cannot allow our children to be mentored by sexual predators. Sexual abuse especially amongst female learners is rife in our communities and it is therefore distressing that such allegations have been made against high ranking members of an organisation that highlights these issues. In the Western Cape where the DA governs we have requested that EE stop all its operations in schools in the province while investigations are pending.
