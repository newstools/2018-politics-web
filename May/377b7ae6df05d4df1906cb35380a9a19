NCOP Considers Political Party Funding Bill 24 May 2018 The Political Party Funding Bill will go through the next phase in the legislative process as the NCOP considers the Bill through a series of meetings, briefings, public submissions and public hearings. The Ad Hoc Committee on the Funding of Political Parties in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will have its first official meeting on Thursday 24 May. The purpose of the meeting will be to adopt the programme of the six weeks’ long deliberations on the Bill. The committee has elected Mr Dikgang Stock of the ANC as the chairperson. The Ad Hoc Committee consists of 6 ANC members, one DA member, one EFF member and one IFP member. The following meetings have also been scheduled and released by Parliament: (note these may change) Thursday 7th June: Briefing by National Treasury and the IEC Thursday 14th June and 20th June: Public Hearings Wednesday 27th June: Consideration of draft Committee Report MVC has been advocating for the transparency of political party donors since 2012 as we believe it will discourage attempts to unduly influence public representatives and prevent corruption. This process is also important because it will provide for a transparent political environment that allows for voters to make an informed vote. Currently MVC is awaiting a Constitutional Court judgement following our application for the Constitutional Court to confirm a Western Cape High Court judgement that ruled the Promotion for Access of Information Act (PAIA) is inconsistent with the Constitution because it does not allow for access to the private funding information of political parties.
