EFF STATEMENT ON SARS ACTING COMMISSIONER REMARKS AT FINANCE COMMITTEE ABOUT RETURN OF ‘ROGUE UNIT’ STAFF Thursday, May 24, 2018 The EFF notes the concerning remarks by the acting Commissioner of South African Revenue Services (SARS) during the Standing Committee of Finance (SCoF) insinuating that people who were either removed or left under the cloud of ‘Rogue Unit’ might come back to SARS. We want to send a strong warning to President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Finance Nhlanhla Nene not to use SARS to settle the ruling party factional battle. SARS is far too important an institution for the people of South Africa, and its credibility in the last few years has been dragged through the mud. The budget shortfall of R48.2 billion announced by the former Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba is a clear demonstration that SARS governance and administrative systems are not as robust and effective as it used to be. The fact that the Minister of Finance is convinced that there are a number of measures in place, through SARS Financial Intelligence Centre and the South African Reserve Bank to deal with illicit financial flows is a clear demonstration of cowardice, mediocrity and inability to manage and solve complex tax administrative problem. The allegations that surround the rogue unit and its activities are of serious nature and some are true. The President must finalize the labour dispute of the suspended Commissioner Tom Moyane and make the necessary appointment to restore stability at SARS. To make any appointments for other senior management positions, whoever will be a Commissioner must follow proper processes to appoint people with correct experience, skills and educational background. All those that were either removed from or left at SARS must not come back to SARS. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 24 May 2018
