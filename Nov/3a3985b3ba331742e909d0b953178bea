IFP Welcomes Adoption of #EskomInquiry Report by Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises 28 November 2018 The IFP welcomes the adoption of the Eskom Inquiry report by the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises which suggests State Capture at Eskom. This report will now be adopted in the National Assembly. The IFP first requested the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises to conduct an investigation into State Capture at Eskom. It is a good day for our democracy as the powers of Parliament has duly been exercised in holding the Executive to account. The Inquiry into Eskom finds former Ministers Lynne Brown and Malusi Gigaba’s lack of oversight was inadequate and led to gross breaches of fiduciary duty and potentially illegal acts. The report suggests a number of individuals must appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, led by Justice Raymond Zondo. We welcome the fact that law enforcement agencies will now be able to investigate certain individuals and that agencies will report back to Parliament by mid-March on progress made on consequences. \ We will continue to be vigilant and ensure that tax payers money is not wasted to the extent that it has been at all state owned enterprises under the watch of the ANC. Issued by Narend Singh, IFP Chief Whip in Parliament, 28 November 2018
