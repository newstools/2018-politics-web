COSATU Gauteng rejects Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba’s apology over his reckless remarks about Ebola 15 November 2018 The Congress of South African Trade Unions in the province of Gauteng rejects Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba’s apology over his reckless remarks about ebola. This is the man who is detached from the reality of the people he claims to lead. His statements are a slap in the face for the small traders and low income households that depend on these traders for their sustenance. He has a xenophobic streak that is toxic for a city like Johannesburg because his statements play the poor against each other. Mashaba is also the same man who immediately after being elected as the executive mayor of Johannesburg remarked that women in the City of Johannesburg slept through their promotions. The federation is not surprised by this consistent attack on the people of Johannesburg and Gauteng because he does not understand the suffering of the working class. He is a stooge for white people who use him to protect their inherited privileges. This is also an indictment on the black political parties that continue to prop up his administration and pander to this political idiot. The people of Johannesburg must also not accept his apology because it is not genuine. Cow heads are a stable diet of many townships all over Gauteng and the surroundings and Mashaba has just insulted all of us. The DA through Mashaba has demonstrated disrespect for the residents of Johannesburg and small black owned businesses. Time has arrived to push back the DA and take them out of power in Johannesburg and Tshwane. Issued by Dumisani Dakile on behalf of COSATU Gauteng, 15 November 2018
