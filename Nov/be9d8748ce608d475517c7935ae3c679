Former Transport MEC badly treated at Bara Hospital, highlights healthcare collapse 7 November 2018 I am saddened by the reported mistreatment of former Gauteng Transport MEC Khabisi Mosunkuntu at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. According to his wife Nonqaba, a physiotherapist refused yesterday to treat her 69-year-old husband who suffered a stroke in July this year. Mrs Mosunkuntu is also a nurse at this hospital and complained “we are sitting here the whole day because somebody is refusing him treatment ... this is what they normally do to patients.” While no-one should expect special treatment because of their previous status, this incident shows once again the rudeness and poor treatment commonly experienced by patients at this hospital. The failing ANC has neglected this hospital and it is inexcusable that a new CEO has not been appointed since the previous CEO was removed by former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu in January 2016. The hospital has also been rocked by corruption allegations and desperately needs good leadership to provide a quality service to all patients.
