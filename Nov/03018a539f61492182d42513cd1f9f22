DA welcomes the election of new Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato 6 November 2018 The Democratic Alliance welcomes the election of Dan Plato as the new Mayor of the City of Cape Town. Mayor Plato, throughout his career, has always proven his commitment to service delivery and his passion to keep the streets of Cape Town safe. The will of the people has now been reaffirmed by this vote and we will continue to deliver against our commitment that we made in 2016. The Mayor has always been above petty politics and will bring much-needed stability, unity and mature leadership to the City which has been lacking over the past number of months. The DA trusts that Mayor Plato will once again restore the people’s faith and confidence in the governance systems of the City of Cape Town. Mayor Plato has been given a mandate by the Party to speed up and restore the highest level of service delivery and putting the people of Cape Town first. We believe that he will, not only, prove himself worthy of this task but that he will excel. The Mayor has also pledged his commitment to lead the fight against the scourge of violent crime and gangsterism in the City – a cause which has always been close to the Mayor’s heart but also central to the DA’s offer. In addition, Mayor Plato will now accelerate projects which will transform the city and ensure that our city is more integrated. The Mayor has not only expressed his commitment to the administrative aspect of the job, but he has also maintained his passion to engage with Capetonians from all walks of life. The Mayor has expressed his eagerness to continue with his listening tour throughout the Cape Town metro to share his vision for the city and to engage with residents on the issues and concerns they face on a daily basis. The DA would like to congratulate the Mayor on his election. Issued by Bonginkosi Madikizela, DA Western Cape Provincial Leader 6 November 2018
