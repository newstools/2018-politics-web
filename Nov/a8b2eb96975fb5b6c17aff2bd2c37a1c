State Security review must be allowed to run its course 11 November 2018 The Presidency has noted weekend media reports alleging internal conflict within the State Security Agency (SSA). The SSA is tasked with providing government with intelligence on domestic and foreign threats or potential threats to national stability, the constitutional order, and the safety and well-being of South Africans. In view of this mandate and in view of concerns over governance and other challenges that had accumulated over time, President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a high-level review panel in June 2018 to assess the mandate, capacity and organisational integrity of the State Security Agency. Chaired by former Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, the 10-member panel is mandated, among other terms of reference, to identify all material factors that allowed for the development of some of the current challenges within the agency, so that appropriate measures can be instituted to prevent a recurrence. The panel has been established to assist in ensuring a responsible and accountable national intelligence capability for the country in line with the Constitution and relevant legislation. While the review process unfolds, political responsibility for the SSA remains with Minister of State Security Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba and management and staff at the Agency are expected to conduct themselves with the requisite responsibility, respect and integrity. The review panel will in due course present its report to President Ramaphosa who has called for this process to be undertaken with the thoroughness demanded in this sensitive environment but also with the expeditiousness required to put an end to longstanding challenges. This process must be allowed to run its course. Statement issued by Khusela Diko, Spokesperson to the President, 11 November 2018
