Gigaba cannot waste public money by taking Public Protector report on review 1 November 2018 On Wednesday, the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, made recommendations that President Cyril Ramaphosa take disciplinary action against Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba for violating the Constitution and the Executive Ethics Code following a complaint by the Democratic Alliance (DA) on the Fireblade matter. The Minister stated that he is studying the report and will advise on his next course of action in due time. Given the ANC government’s track record, this probably means that the Minister will take this report on review. The DA will oppose any effort by the Minister to review the Public Protector’s recommendations using taxpayers’ funds. The Minister has already spent R874 199.25 in public funds in defending the Fireblade case. After his appeal to the Constitutional Court was dismissed, he approached the Supreme Court of Appeal which similarly dismissed his application. Gigaba has since indicated his intention to approach the Constitutional Court again to appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals. The South African public purse cannot be ransacked to finance the Minister’s fanciful legal actions in perpetuity. Doing so has emboldened the Minister to tap the public purse with reckless abandon. Most recently this was the case regarding the defamation action instituted by the Minister against journalist Redi Thlabi for a slight on Twitter. President Ramaphosa must not only draw the line for Gigaba, he must rid the country once and for all of this compromised Minister. The President must begin to restore public confidence in the commitment of the government to ethical, accountable leadership by firing Gigaba.
