DA requests meeting with Minister Cele for update on SAPS State Capture investigations The Democratic Alliance has written to the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, to request an urgent meeting to discuss the progress of investigations into charges the DA has laid related to State Capture. South Africans deserve an update and transparency from the police on these investigations and the developments therein. The DA has been integral in countering the scourge of State Capture that has become endemic in the failing ANC government. This has been achieved through strong parliamentary oversight, the laying of criminal charges, strict reporting to the Public Protector and the driving of the creation of the Eskom Inquiry. To date, the DA has laid these charges against the following relevant personnel and entities: On the 17-Nov-16: Brian Molefe, in terms of the following acts, with regards to the Public Protector State Capture Report and Molefe’s abuse of powers in dealing with Gupta-owned entities On the 28-Nov-16: Eskom and Trillian, CAS 70/11/2016. The DA’s affidavit concerns possible criminal and/or statutory offences committed On the 27-Mar-17: Mantshela Koko, former CEO of Eskom, and his alleged acts of maleficence, CAS 2067/5/2017. On the 20-Jul-17: Anoj Singh, former CFO of Eskom for his alleged part in state capture, CAS 1685/7/2017. On the 19-Sep-17: McKinsey & Trillian for their alleged role in state capture CAS 1156/9/2017. On the 29-Sep-17: SAP for implications of corruption, CAS 1800/9/2017. On the 30-Sep-17: Just Coal and its alleged involvement in corruption, CAS 1803/9/2017. On the 8-Mar-18: Bank of Baroda for their alleged involvement in illicit funds linked to the Guptas, CAS 454/3/2018. On the 17-Apr-18: Denel for a Bursary of R1 million paid to the son of the North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo. We have also laid charges against Transnet and Mr. Gama, former CEO of Transnet. The police have a responsibility to investigate the charges against those who have been implicated in the looting of our state. On Tuesday, 27 November 2018, my colleague, DA Shadow Minister of Police Zakhele Mbhele, and myself, will be visiting the Cape Town Central Police Station, in order to provide SAPS with additional information for the affidavits the DA has submitted thus far. We will be supplementing our existing cases with the evidence provided by the following chapters in the explosive Treasury Report: Chapter I: Final Report: Forensic Investigation into Various Allegations at Transnet Chapter II: Mckinsey, Trillian and Regiments Chapter III: Report relating to Eskom investigations The DA will continue to fight for every rand that was stolen, so that every missing cent be returned to South Africa and so that those implicated in state capture are brought to book. South Africans want to see corrupted politicians, officials and corporates face the consequences of their actions and be put behind bars.
