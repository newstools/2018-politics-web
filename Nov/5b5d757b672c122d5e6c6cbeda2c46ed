Auditor General confirms Western Cape as cleanest government 21 November 2018 The Auditor General’s presentation in Parliament this morning confirms that the Western Cape runs the cleanest provincial government in South Africa. The Western Cape once again received by far the highest number of clean audits in South Africa in 2017/18 across all entities and departments, with 83% clean audit outcomes achieved, compared to Gauteng at 52%. Premier Zille says: “Thanks must go to officials at all levels of this government for the turnaround we’ve accomplished over two terms in office. In 2009 not a single Department had a clean audit. Since then, we have been able to entrench a culture of good governance and accountability to the people of the Western Cape.” A total of 11 out of 13 provincial departments received clean audits overall, and 12 out of 13 received an unqualified opinion on their financial statements thus far. We look forward to making our case in court to review and set aside the Auditor General’s interpretation of the Department of Agriculture’s audit outcome in due time. This would bring the province’s unqualified audit percentage to 100%. Additional to the Auditor General’s reports today, the Western Cape has consistently come out as the top financial performer according to the Presidency’s Performance Management Assessment Tool (MPAT) for the last five years.
