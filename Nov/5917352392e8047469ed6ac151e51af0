DA Gauteng calls for inquiry into state of mental healthcare facilities 20 November 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) will submit a request to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature, Nompi Nhlapo, to launch an urgent inquiry into the state of mental healthcare facilities. This as 90  workers at the San Michele Home for the mentally disabled in Brakpan are protesting over a wage dispute. One patient has died and the lives of more than 200 other patients in danger. San Michele Home for the mentally challenged is a registered NPO, which has been in existence since 1945, relying mainly on government funding and donations from the public. Many of the patients in its care, who are between 18 and 84, have no family and no means of support other than that provided by the home. It has also been brought to the DA’s attention that residents are not receiving any adult diapers or dry food from the Department of Health, making the daily provision to residents difficult. Last year, San Michele approached the North Gauteng High Court to force the Gauteng Department of Health to pay more than R2-million owed to it in subsidies. Although the court ordered the department to pay up, which they subsequently did, the home finds itself in the same predicament. The San Michele home is paid R4 100 per month per patient to cover food, salaries for staff members, medical treatment, toiletries, clothing and bedding. The DA calls for  the portfolio committee of health to speedily intervene in the current wage dispute at the home and ensure the home is paid all outstanding subsidies to keep its doors open. Only the DA can bring change that Builds One South Africa for and ensures that Gauteng’s most vulnerable people are cared for.
