The fight over land only starts now 15 November 2018 The fight over land and expropriation without compensation only starts now. The drastic decision taken today by Parliament's Constitutional Review Committee to give the green light, despite great public opposition, for amending the Constitution to make expropriation without compensation possible does not mean the process has been finalised. Throughout the process, the FF Plus was in the front lines in the fight against expropriation without compensation and the party will continue to oppose the ANC and the EFF in regard to this. The party will continue with its international awareness campaign and on the 27th of November this year, when the report of the Constitutional Review Committee is up for debate in Parliament, the FF Plus will once again be ready to fight for property rights in South Africa. There is also the possibility that a legal process can be followed to set the Committee's decision aside seeing as the process that the Committee followed was flawed and riddled with errors. The ANC government's actions just once again signify that the time is here for the public to stand up and get involved and fight alongside the FF Plus against the ANC that is leading South Africa down a path of total destruction.
