Kathrada Foundation welcomes arrests of murder suspects 7 November 2018 The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has welcomed the arrests of nine suspects who may be linked to the murder of anti-apartheid struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada’s nephew and grand-nephew. Yunus Kathrada and his son, Moulana Ahmed, were shot outside their house in Schweizer-Reneke last week in an apparent attempted robbery. Yunus died on scene while his son passed on a short while later after being rushed to hospital. The suspects are expected to appear in Court tomorrow. The Foundation’s Neeshan Balton, said that the family was deeply appreciative of the cooperation and assistance from police, but were at the same time saddened that young people were amongst the suspects. “The Foundation commends the police for the speed with which the arrests have been made. What this case, and the recent Vlakfontein Khoza family murder case indicates, is that the South African police do have the capability to apprehend suspects involved in violent crimes. “We hope that this leads to successful prosecution, and that it sends a strong signal that we are making headway in the battle against crime.” Balton added though that the quick action of police “must be replicated across the country and is something that all victims of violent crime should benefit from”.
