MEDIA STATEMENT BY THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES THE FUTURE OF SAA 04 NOVEMBER 2018 – South African Airways (SAA) is a good airline but a poorly run business. Bad decisions were made by previous boards and management, including allowing corruption to incapacitate the airline. Against this background, the immediate priority for the Ministry of Public Enterprises, is to stabilise SAA financially and through a rigorous process of cost-reduction and commercial re-orientation, to turn it into an airline that is financially and operationally sustainable. The recent appropriation of R5bn in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement was a further expression of this intent and provides a degree of immediate financial stability while the airline’s board and management proceed with the task restore the airline financially and operationally. Cognizant of the challenges confronting the airline, the Ministry will place the board and management on notice to discharge, with a greater sense of urgency and dedication, their professional duties to identify and implement immediate interventions. It is imperative that the executive management apply its mind with clear focus to the immediate task at hand, including addressing the airline’s cost-base, stopping all fraudulent contracts, disciplining and instituting appropriate civil and criminal actions against all persons inside and outside the business who are implicated in corruption, and preparing SAA for a strategic equity partner in the near future. This is the path to ensure the future sustainability of the airline, the preservation of jobs and for SAA to become a vibrant competitor in the aviation market in South Africa and globally.
