EFF TAKES LEGAL ADVICE ON AMABUNGANE REGARDING JOBURG VEHICLE FLEET TENDER ARTICLE Thursday, 29 November, 2018 The EFF has referred the Amabungane article regarding the Johannesburg Metro Vehicle Fleet Tender article, published today in the Daily Maverick, to legal council on the basis of defamation. The EFF is of the stern opinion that the article is an open smear campaign, against the EFF and its leadership as it admittedly has no evidence for its claims, yet still proceeds to cast aspersions on the reputation of the EFF and its leadership. The article constitutes unfair reporting, using anonymous sources that offer no proof for their claims. In this regard, the article is based on gossip, making Amabungane a gossip investigation unit and Daily Maverick a tabloid publication, pushing pure and baseless gossip. The reputation of the EFF and its leadership must now be protected against journalists, who are obsessed with taking down a revolutionary political formation that is unsettling to the white monopoly establishment. We will announce, following legal advice, as to which route we will take between a court and the Ombudsman. Enough is enough. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 29 November 2018
