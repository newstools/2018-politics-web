DA calls on Ministers to be transparent about Rustenburg’s Eskom debt 20 November 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West will write to the Minister of Energy, Jeff Radebe, and the Minister of COGTA, Zweli Mkhize and the Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, requesting that they provide details on the alleged dispute between Rustenburg Local Municipality and the National Energy Regulation Authority (Nersa). This follows the Municipality’s rejection of Eskom’s claims that the Municipality owes a R260 million debt. The Municipality is adamant that Eskom’s claim is not correct and have since lodged a dispute with Nersa. The DA maintains that the information made available to us by Eskom was done so in good faith. In the interest of the transparency and accountability, the DA requires the Ministers to disclose: - The total breakdown of the amount owed to Eskom by the Rustenburg Local Municipality; - The exact details of the dispute between Eskom and Rustenburg Local Municipality; - When the dispute was lodged and by which date it will be resolved; - The reasons for the secrecy surrounding the dispute by both NERSA and the Rustenburg Local Municipality. The truth is, the failing ANC is to blame for the escalating multi-million Rand debt. The corruption, failed governance, poor financial planning and a general culture of financial mismanagement inherent in all spheres of government under the ANC robs the people of economic opportunities and denies them basic service delivery which further entrenches poverty. The DA will continue to engage the people of the North West to convince them to vote for change in 2019. The DA remains the only party in government with a credible track record in improving the lives of people through good, transparent and responsive governance and the delivery of quality basic services to all.
