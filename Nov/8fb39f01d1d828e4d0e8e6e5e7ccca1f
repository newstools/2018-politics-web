2973. Ms A Steyn (DA) to ask the President of the Republic: Whether he is aware of the high number of murders and attacks on farmers and farmworkers that have been occurring since 1 January 2009; if so, why did he state in a media interview on 26 September 2018 that no murders of farmers are taking place in South Africa (details furnished)? NW3287E REPLY: My comment during an interview with Bloomberg on 26 September 2018 was in response to a tweet by US President Donald Trump which stated that there are “large scale killings of farmers” in South Africa. As I indicated in the interview, and as I continue to maintain, this statement is incorrect and misinformed. Throughout South Africa, violent crime is a matter of serious concern, regardless of where it occurs or whom it affects. The South African Police Service first began reporting on the rate of murders of farmers and farm workers for the 2010/11 financial year, during which it was reported that 80 farmers and farm workers we killed. This number has fluctuated over the years: 56 in 2011/12, 59 in 2012/13, 57 in 2013/14, 60 in 2014/15, 58 in 2015/16 and 74 in 2016/17. According to the crime statistics, approximately 21,000 murders took place in South Africa in 2017/18, of which 62 murders occurred in farms and smallholdings, which translates to approximately 0.3% of the total number of murders. We strongly condemn all murders in the country, including of farmers and farm workers, and are committed to do everything possible to defend every citizen of our country, regardless of where they live and work, from all forms of violence. We call on all South Africans to work together with government to tackle crime and violence throughout society. Issued by Parliament, 2 November 2018
