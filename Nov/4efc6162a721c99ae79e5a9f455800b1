9 appear in court for murder of Ahmed Kathrada's relatives 8 November 2018 Nine suspects, aged between 16 and 60, appeared in the Schweizer-Reneke Magistrate’s Court on Thursday in connection with the murder of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Kathrada’s relatives. Kathdrada’s 65-year-old nephew Yunus and his 28-year-old son, also named Ahmed, were killed earlier this month in an apparent botched robbery, although nothing was stolen from their home at the time. It is believed that Ahmed had just returned home from mosque when the attack occurred. Police spokesperson Colonel Adele Myburgh said that Ahmed was overpowered by two suspects when he arrived home on November 1, 2018, and shot in the chest. His mother apparently heard the commotion and called her husband, Yunus. He opened the back door and was then shot in the back of the head. He died on the scene. Ahmed was taken to hospital, but died on arrival. Nothing was stolen from the house. According to the North West police, the nine suspects, who were arrested on November 6, appeared on two counts of murder and one of attempted robbery. A gun and two vehicles, believed to have been used in the murders, were confiscated. According to Myburgh, the suspects are Xolani Andrew Sotshantsha, 25, Mogomotsi Moruwa, 31, Abiya Jeffrey Phakoane, 60, Adam Mohale, 31, Sello Bamphitile, 29, Godfrey Thabiso Cuna, 46, Kgotso Moeletsi, 29, Thato Levetti, 26, and a 16-year-old. She said they would remain in custody until their next court appearance on November 14 in the Schweizer-Reneke Magistrate's Court. The 16-year-old boy was being held in a juvenile facility, she said.
