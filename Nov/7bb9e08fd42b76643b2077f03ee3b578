PRASA is failing KZN commuters 6 November 2018 The DA will be seeking an urgent meeting the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) CEO, Sibusiso Sithole, following an early morning oversight inspection at Isipingo train station at Berea train station. During the inspection, the DA interacted with commuters who expressed concern about the inconsistent and unreliable service given by PRASA. In the request for a meeting sent to Sithole, the DA hopes to discuss feasible solutions that could help alleviate the challenges faced by commuters in and around the City. Of major concern for consumers, were the repeated delays in train arrival, absence of security guards in coaches and inconsistencies in service delivery. Late trains have hit people oppressed by poverty the hardest as some have lost their jobs, while some have been served with warnings for arriving late at work. The failing ANC has not only failed to ensure fair access to real and long-term jobs in Kwa Zulu Natal (KZN), but it is also jeopardizing jobs of the few who are still employed due to erratic public transport services. It also came to our attention that PRASA has discontinued monthly travel coupons and only retained the daily and weekly options. This means that consumers have to spend more on transport, further constraining their ability to make ends meet in a struggling economy. The DA strongly believes that a reliable, safe and efficient public transportation system benefits commuters and drives economic growth as people arrive at work on time. In 2019 people of KZN have an opportunity to elect a government that will put them first through the provision of an integrated and efficient public transport system.
