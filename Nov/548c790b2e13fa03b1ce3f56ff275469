EFF CONDEMNS NZIMANDE'S EFF SCAPEGOAT ON VBS BANK FUNDING TO SACP Monday, 12 November, 2018 The EFF condemns Blade Nzimande's attempt to use the EFF as a scapegoat when confronted with the claims that SACP received VBS Bank funds. In his interview with the eNCA, Nzimande claims that the accusation, that SACP received R3 million in funds from Vele's subsidiary, MML Food Service, came from EFF. This is a blatant lie. These claims come from a City Press report, that relied on VBS Bank executives and managers who indicate that they were instructed to fund the SACP. We reject the attempt to divert attention from the SACP to the EFF in failure to be accountable. In addition, we condemn the media's uncritical usage of this version by Nzimande, instead of putting facts to him, which are now a matter of public record. SACP must man up and face accountability, without mention of the EFF. Furthermore, there are allegations that Adv. Terry Motau, who compiled the VBS "Bank Heist" report, was informed by the bank executives of this payment to the SACP, yet he did not include it in the report. This is evidence of how bias and doctored his report is, in that it sought to protect the SACP from scrutiny and public accountability. Why would you not include such important information, when executives tell you that they were instructed to make payments to a political party, without any invoice Or evidence of any work. In the true style Of Adv. Motau, why didn't he call this payment "gratuitous payment", and interview the SACP as well to hear how they explain the money given to them for no apparent reason? The EFF reiterates that all those who received money illegally from VBS Bank must be criminally prosecuted, without any fear or favour.
