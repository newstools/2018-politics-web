Rustenburg Municipality owes Eskom millions 6 November 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West notes the letter released by the Rustenburg Local Municipality circulating on social media, claiming that the DA is not being factual about the municipality’s Eskom debt. The DA is in possession of an official Eskom document stating that the Rustenburg Local Municipality owes a R260 million debt. The municipality’s claim that they have lodged a dispute with Nersa is duly noted. However, that bears no relevance on our statement issued yesterday relating to the punitive scheduled blackouts experienced by the people within the Tswaing Local Municipality. The truth is, the failing ANC is to blame for the escalating multi-million rand debt. The corruption, failed governance, poor financial planning and a general culture of financial mismanagement inherent in all spheres of government under the ANC robs the people of economic opportunities and denies them basic service delivery which further entrenches poverty. The DA will continue to expose the failures of the ANC in government. The DA will continue to engage the people of the North West to convince them to vote for change in 2019. The DA remains the only party in government with a credible track record in improving the lives of people through good, transparent and responsive governance and the delivery of quality basic services to all.
