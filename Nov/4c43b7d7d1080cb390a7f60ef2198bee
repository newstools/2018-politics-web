ANC government lets women down badly 30 November 2018 With the ANC government at the steer of things, South Africa actually needs 365 days of activism of no violence against women and children and not just 16 days. Women are let down by the country's police and legal system because the support for victims of traumatic incidences is shockingly inadequate. The FF Plus in the Free State recently came to the aid of a woman from Botshabelo in Mangaung who was raped by four men. She knew her attackers, identified them and had to testify against them numerous times. Each time she testified, she had to relive the emotional trauma of what happened to her. In between giving evidence, she had to sit in close proximity to the leader of her rapists. To top it all off, half of the dossier went missing. This is but one example of how the police and the legal system of our country are letting women down. Even the government is failing women with its quota system which is only cosmetically implemented and thus it sends the message that women are not really equal to men and that they need a quota system to be competitive. The present system must be changed and improved at once, starting with the police and legal system, so that the women of South Africa can be properly protected.
