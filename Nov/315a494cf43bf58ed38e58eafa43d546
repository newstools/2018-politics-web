Accountability looms for SABC's Aguma 13 November 2018 OUTA welcomes the announcement made by the SIU to hold the former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and former acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), James Aguma, to account. Aguma is registered as a practicing accountant with the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA), which ensures that the actions of individuals practicing under the umbrella of this esteemed institution are held to the highest standards of ethical governance in the South African accounting fraternity. This has been a long time coming as OUTA registered a formal complaint with SAICA on 24 May 2017, to Investigate Aguma for his involvement in the financial woes of the embattled public broadcaster. After following due process, we are confident that, with sufficient input, SAICA will now apply the strongest oversight onto individuals registered with them. “We are encouraged that James Aguma will be held accountable for his contribution to bringing the SABC to its knees”, says Dominique Msibi, OUTA’s Portfolio Manager for Special Projects; which among others, includes the public broadcasting sector. “This outcome continues to confirm that transgressors who have captured our State Owned Entities and economy for at least the past decade for personal gain, will not escape the long arm of the law, and will face other consequences for their actions,” added Msibi.
