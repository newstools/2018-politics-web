DA gives SAPS more evidence on State Capture 27 November 2018 Earlier this month, National Treasury released three reports which detail explosive findings of State Capture at Transnet and Eskom which implicate the companies McKinsey and Trillian. The DA submitted these reports as supplementary evidence into the police’s investigations into State Capture and criminal cases already opened by the DA against several government officials. The DA has pursued every possible channel available to ensure that those who were implicated in State Capture are held accountable including parliamentary oversight, opening criminal cases, reporting to the Public Protector and advocating for the Eskom Inquiry. The DA also enquired about the state of investigations into State Capture. To date, we have laid the following 10 sets of charges against the following people or institutions: On 17 November 2016: Brian Molefe, in terms of the following acts, with regards to the Public Protector State Capture Report and Molefe’s abuse of powers in dealing with Gupta-owned entities; On 28 November 2016: Eskom and Trillian, CAS 70/11/2016. The DA’s affidavit concerns possible criminal and/or statutory offences committed; On 27 March 2017: Mantshela Koko, former CEO of Eskom, and his alleged acts of criminality, CAS 2067/5/2017; On 20 July 2017: Anoj Singh, former CFO of Eskom for his alleged part in state capture, CAS 1685/7/2017; On 19 September 2017: McKinsey & Trillian for their alleged role in state capture CAS 1156/9/2017; On29 September 2017: SAP for implications of corruption, CAS 1800/9/2017; On 30 September 2017: Just Coal and its alleged involvement in corruption, CAS 1803/9/2017; On 8 March 2018: Bank of Baroda for their alleged involvement in illicit funds linked to the Guptas, CAS 454/3/2018; On 17 April 2018: Denel for a Bursary of R1 million paid to the son of the North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo; and We have also laid charges against Transnet and Mr. Siyabonga Gama, former CEO of Transnet. The police have a responsibility to probe those who have been implicated in looting the state and it is vital that they update South Africans on the charges in the interests of transparency. The DA will continue to fight to ensure that those implicated in State Capture are brought to book. Issued by Natasha Mazzone, DA Spokesperson on State Capture, 27 November 2018
