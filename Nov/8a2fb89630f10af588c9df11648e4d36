Official response by Fireblade Aviation to finding by Constitutional Court 1 November 2018 Fireblade Aviation is pleased that the Constitutional Court has dismissed Minister Malusi Gigaba’s application for leave to appeal. This follows three separate rulings by the Pretoria High Court, a Full Bench of that Court, and the Supreme Court which have all found in Fireblade’s favour. With this decision, these legal proceedings have now concluded. We are satisfied with the result and the manner in which the legal process has culminated in a just and fair outcome. Fireblade also welcomed the opportunity to brief the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs on Tuesday, on matters pertaining to the establishment and operations of Fireblade. We are extraordinarily proud of the Fireblade operation, which we believe is on par with globally recognised such facilities at major airports around the world. We believe that Fireblade is in the process of achieving its ambition – providing a first-class service for the benefit of South Africans and international guests while visiting our country.
