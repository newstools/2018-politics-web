Newly built R33 million school sits empty while learners use old, unsafe school 14 November 2018 Following a recent oversight inspection to the Tsoseletso Intermediate School in Ratlou, the Democratic Alliance established that the newly built school, at a cost of R33 million, remain unused, while learners and teachers are forced to learn and work in the dilapidated and unsafe structures of the old school. The DA will today write to the MEC for Education, Sello Lehari, calling on him to account and ensure that the new buildings become operational immediately and that measures are taken to ensure that the school receives adequate water supply. There is a lack of adequate water supply, leaving learners and teachers without any access to clean drinking water and sanitation. The DA is concerned that a lack of water supply, especially during the current heatwave, places learners and teachers at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. Learners are also forced to make use of broken chairs and desks. The failing ANC has done its best to destroy quality education through a compromised curriculum, the appointment of unqualified teachers, and slow service delivery. The situation at this school is not conducive to quality learning. The DA-led government in the Western Cape has tremendously improved the quality of education in the province. Qualitatively and quantitatively Western Cape learners far outperform learners in other provinces. The North West needs change that will ensure the delivery of quality education, and the DA is the only party in government with the track record to do this.
