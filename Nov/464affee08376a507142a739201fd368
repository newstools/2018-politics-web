Expropriation without compensation undermines constitutional legitimacy 15 November 2018 “The Constitutional Review Committee’s recommendation that the Constitution be amended to allow expropriation without compensation undermines South Africa’s constitutional legitimacy. The reason is that confiscation in the sense contemplated by Parliament is an affront to the very idea of constitutionalism.” So says Piet le Roux, CEO of the business organisation Sakeliga, upon the announcement by the Committee of its recommendations. Le Roux says that Sakeliga will continue to oppose the amendment of the constitution, since the proposed amendments remain fundamentally unacceptable.
