EFF WELCOMES THE RESIGNATION OF MALUSI GIGABA THE LIAR Tuesday, 13 November, 2018 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) welcomes the resignation by the disgraced Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba the liar who has been found by a court of law to have lied under oath. His stubbomness to remain in office despite the undeniable evidence against him regarding the Fireblade Airport saga and his blatant disregard for the rule of law, have made him a dishonourable public representative and have clearly illustrated that he does not have the interests of the people of South Africa at heart. Malusi Gigaba had been a Gupta stooge who was the engine of state capture under Jacob Zuma. He ensured that the Guptas attain citizenship in South Africa, aiding them to qualify for deals with State Owned Enterprises. Throughout his tenure as Minister Malusi Gigaba has been a shame, corrupt and unpatriotic. We also note, that President Ramaphosa has requested the incapacitated Minister Blade Nzimande, who is dismally failing in his current portfolio, to act as the Minister of Home Affairs. The recycling of old and tired cadres of the ANC speaks to the heart of the bankruptcy of the party and its leadership. We hope moving forward the president will find a young, fresh and incorruptible mind to lead in this role. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 13 November 2018
