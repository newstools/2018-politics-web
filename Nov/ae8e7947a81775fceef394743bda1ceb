Emerging farmers need more support 13 November 2018 The Democratic Alliance in the Northern Cape calls on the provincial Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development to do more to ensure the continued success of emerging farmers. More suitable land and opportunities, such as the transfer of skills and access to markets for the sale of goods, must be made available to emerging farmers. Our call follows an oversight inspection this morning to the portion of the commonage land in Galeshewe, which the Sol Plaatje Local Municipality rents from the Platfontein community. As the Democratic Alliance, we are happy to see that many of the emerging farmers take full advantage of the opportunity being offered and are using their land to the economic benefit of the community. Agriculture remains an important sector in the economic growth of the region and the province as a whole. But it is a concern that the loose control and poor implementation of regulations may deprive some emerging farmers from opportunities. The arrangement is that, once a farmer has more than fifty sheep or thirty cattle, he must vacate the commonage land and find alternative land. This, unfortunately, does not happen. Some of the farmers currently present on the commonage have herds of more than eighty animals and their continued presence on the commonage denies other emerging farmers the opportunity to develop their businesses. This attitude is not only selfish, but hampers the economic development of the municipality. It is only the Democratic Alliance which has shown that it has the political will to implement land use policies which aids economic development, assists emerging farmers and supports the growth of our communities.
