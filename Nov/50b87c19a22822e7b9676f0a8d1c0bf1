DA calls on Minister Motsoaledi to account for the R154 000 “payment” he received 26 November 2018 The DA in the Free State will write to the Health Minister, Aron Motsoaledi, requesting that he accounts for the R154 000 that was allegedly paid to him Stanley Bakili, who is a business partner to Louis Siemens. Siemens owned Citymed and was assassinated after he threatened to expose individuals whom he had bribed to gate the City Med contract. In a sworn statement, Bakili claims to have made a deposit of R154 000 to the Health Minister, Aron Motsoaledi, as part of efforts by Citymed to improve its chances for an application it made to expand its licence. Bakili alleges that he deposited R84 000 on the 8 November 2017 and R70 000 on 17 November 2018 into the Minister’s account. Also implicated in these allegations are: The FS Department of Health’s HOD, Dr David Motau, who was paid R 100 000 on the 27 and R50 000 on the 28 November 2017. Ms Pinki Balot was given R 10 000 on the 01 November 2017 and R12 800 on the 21 November 2017 Mr Justice Finger who is committee member was given R231 000 in total on five different days. If these allegations are true, the Minister will have to come clean and explain his involvement in this deal and whether or not he received the alleged payment. Motsoaledi must clear his name as these are serious allegations which border on bribery and corrupting a public official to obtain favour for government contracts. The DA will give the minister seven days to respond to these allegations failing which we will report him to the Parliament’s Ethics Committee for further investigations. In 2019 residents of the Free State have an opportunity to elect a DA government that will promote clean governance and prosecute anyone found guilty of corruption, regardless of the public office that they hold.
