DA calls for urgent intervention to resolve chaos at SASSA Meyerton Office 26 November 2018 The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) at the Meyerton Local Office is affected by serious staff shortages, issues with its card swap processes and poor client relations and management. Today, the Democratic Alliance (DA) Team One Gauteng Spokesperson on Social Cohesion and Forgotten Communities, Bridget Masango, and Midvaal Constituency Head Dennis Ryder, conducted an oversight inspection to the SASSA Meyerton Office and engaged grant beneficiaries who alerted the DA to their plight. It is unacceptable that SASSA has not succeeded in migrating all cash recipients of social grants who used to be paid by Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to the new SASSA Post Office cards. The migration is part of a Constitutional Court judgment issued last year, which found that the contract between SASSA and CPS was unlawful. It was concerning to hear beneficiaries complaining about having to wait for three to four months for their grants while they struggle to feed their families.  It is a staggering indication of the high levels of a leadership vacuum and lack of political will to look after the poor and vulnerable. Only the DA can bring change that accelerates the delivery of service and puts the people first. We call upon all citizens to vote for the party that is working to build One South Africa for All.
