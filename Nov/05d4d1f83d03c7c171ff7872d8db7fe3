DA asks Director of Prosecutions to investigate suspect withdrawal of intimidation case against ANC member 27 November 2018 The DA has written to KZN Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions, Adv. Moipone Noko, requesting that she investigates the suspicious circumstances that saw the withdrawal of charges of intimidation and firing a firearm by ANC member at DA councillors. This shocking decision was apparently taken after what is claimed to be “problems” with the docket. The DA finds this unacceptable and is requesting the Provincial Director to look into what is clearly a miscarriage of justice. Many cases have gone cold in this manner in our criminal justice system because of missing time. The DA will not let this case become another statistic. On Friday a suspect was arrested based on the evidence given by the DA councillors after an incident of intimidation that happened last week where DA councillors were attacked during campaign activities in Kwanyuswa. The DA suspect foul play and political interference in this case and is calling on prosecuting authorities to investigate. It was disappointing to see ANC members who came out in numbers to support an ANC member who blocked councillors of the opposition party and even went as far as firing a firearm in a residential area, putting lives of many at risk. The DA will continue to fight for a police and judicial system that is honest and professional, and will act to ensure the safety of all people regardless of political party affiliation.
