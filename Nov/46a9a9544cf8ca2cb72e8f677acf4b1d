Public Protector Report confirms the past mismanagement of Pikitup 1 November 2018 The City of Johannesburg notes the Public Protector’s report confirming the allegations of mismanagement, maladministration and abuse of power that took place in Pikitup under the leadership of Amanda Nair. From 2013, Pikitup and Amanda Nair came under public scrutiny relating to allegations of tender irregularities, mismanagement and nepotistic hiring practices. The Public Protector’s report details the extent to which these matters were in the public domain due to SAMWU and the media’s work in exposing the wrong doing. Despite the fact that these matters transpired under the previous administration, the multi-party government will be engaging the Board of Pikitup on the findings and remedial action contained in the Public Protector’s report. What is evident from the report is that Amanda Nair was able to run Pikitup like a personal fiefdom. The extent of the rot in Pikitup was pervasive, and it was public knowledge at the time. What remains unanswered, in the Public Protector’s report, is where were the previous Mayor, Cllr Parks Tau, or MMC for EISD, Cllr Matshidiso Mfikoe, in addressing the wrongdoing which was taking place? Why was Amanda Nair and the previous Board of Pikitup allowed to act as a law unto themselves? I would like to express my deep appreciation and note the critical role played by SAMWU in exposing the nepotistic hiring practices within Pikitup. We regret the extent to which the previous administration ignored their valid concerns and, as was the norm under the Tau administration, swept the allegations under the carpet to protect the connected few. The City of Johannesburg will be working with the Board of Pikitup to ensure that those responsible for the reign of mismanagement that characterised Pikitup in the past are held to account.
