#DrosRapeCase: Justice has been denied for yet another child 29 November 2018 Justice has once again been denied for the six-year-old girl who was allegedly raped and sexually assaulted by Nicholas Ninow at a Dros restaurant in Tshwane. The Pretoria Magistrate Court on Wednesday postponed the case to next year as Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital did not have a bed available to admit Ninow for psychiatric testing. This means yet another child’s case is being delayed due to the ANC’s continued failure to provide critical services like a functioning health system that can work in tandem with the criminal justice system. Justice delayed is justice denied. The alleged perpetrator of this heinous crime is now able to momentarily able to escape justice and accountability while this young girl and her family live with the horror and fear of what happened that day. This truly, yet again underscores the need for sexual offences courts which will prioritise the needs of the victims of sexual violence in conjunction with a provincial government that cares for the most the vulnerable.
