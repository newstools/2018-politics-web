COSATU shocked by SAPU application to interdict anti gang unit 22 November 2018 COSATU has learned with shock that SAPS union SAPU submitted an application to Labour Court, to have the newly established Anti Gang Unit interdicted. This because it’s alleged the SSSBC procedures was not followed. Section  85 of the Constitution of the country was followed, and President acted in the best interest of the citizens, who was caught in a drug and gang war on the Cape Flats During its first days, this unit has yielded huge successes with drugs, guns and gang kingpins being arrested. The festive season is upon us, and the removal of the Anti Gang Unit will be a catalyst for bloodshed and crime COSATU is therefore appalled by the SAPU leadership, who now plays political games with the lives of people on the Cape Flats. The leadership of SAPU must be warned that should this interim interdict be granted, the blood of the victims will be placed at their doors. COSATU will not allow the lives of workers to be degraded to a political ball game, and with our social partner , Western Cape united Safety  Forum , will mobilise the communities and members to march to the offices of SAPU and Provincial Government , if  this interdict is granted. We call on the Presidency and the National leadership of POPCRU to urgently oppose this application Issued by Malvern De Bruyn on behalf of COSATU, 22 November 2018
