SADTU North West saddened by the brutal killing of Grade 1 learner 22 November 2018 The South African Democratic Teacher Union in the North West (SADTU NW) is shocked and perplexed by the gruesome killing of a Grade 1 learner at Dikeledi Makapan Primary school in Makapanstaad. It is alleged that a Grade 11 learner from Manakale Technical High School, who had been hiding in the primary school toilets, stabbed the Grade 1 learner multiple times until he met his untimely death. This incident happens just days before the start of the 16 Days of Activism for NO Violence against Women and Children, which is aimed to raising awareness of the negative impact that violence and abuse have on women and children and to rid society of abuse permanently. This also happens after stakeholders during the School Safety Summit, held in October, committed themselves to strengthen relationships between learners, teachers, parents and communities to create safer school environments, so that quality education can be delivered. We call upon the law enforcement agencies to fully investigate the matter and the perpetrator to face the full wrath of the law. The Government should step in and priorities safety in our schools because enough is enough; we can no longer tolerate these barbaric acts.Â Further, we urge communities to take their rightful place and protect schools, learners and teachers as violence against these institutions leads to the regression of society. As the National Executive Committee of SADTU is about to convene, we will advocate that the Union develop a vigorous Programme of Action to deal with the challenges of safety of teachers and learners in our schools. We express our heartfelt condolences to the family, the school and the community at large for this untimely death of this innocent soul.
