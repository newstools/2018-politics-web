EFF Students Command victorious in preliminary results of UCT's SRC elections 2 October 2018 The preliminary results of the hotly contested Student Representative Council (SRC) elections at the University of Cape Town (UCT) indicate a major victory for the Economic Freedom Fighters Students Command (EFFSC). The results differ significantly from last year when the Democratic Alliance Students Organisation (DASO) held the majority - nine out of 15 seats. The EFFSC has almost matched the results this year by claiming eight out of the nine seats, pending the submission of campaign spending reports and the finalisation of complaints received. The ANC-aligned South African Students Congress (Sasco) only managed to secure two seats, and the remaining seats were filled by independent candidates. "Out of the first 15 duly elected, nine are women and six are men," UCT spokesperson Nombuso Shabalala said. The final results are expected to be announced on Wednesday. DA member of Parliament Phumzile van Damme congratulated the EFFSC but added a subtle warning. "Congratulations on your victory. You were formidable opponents. DASO worked extremely hard on the back of an extremely tough year," she tweeted. "Lead, and lead well, for DASO UCT will be breathing down your neck at all times." The EFFSC has been victorious on campuses throughout the country. Three days ago, they won the SRC elections at the University of Zululand's Ongoye campus by taking all 10 seats. They also took over Mangosuthu University of Technology and Durban University of Technology. News24
