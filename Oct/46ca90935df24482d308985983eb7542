41 000 Patients treated for violence and accident injuries at Bara hospital 25 October 2018 More than 3000 patients a month are treated for violence and accident-related injuries at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. These shock figures are revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. Last year, 40 802 patients were treated in the trauma emergency unit, broken down as follows: 15 853 orthopaedic injuries 9203 other injuries 5052 assault victims 3235 stab wounds 2601 motor vehicle accident 2036 pedestrian vehicle accidents 1628 burns 949 gun shots 36 suicide by hanging There were 3400 trauma injuries per month treated in 2017, decreasing somewhat to 3141 injuries per month so far this year. The violence extends to the Casualty unit itself where patients sometimes threaten staff. According to Ramokgopa, there was a major incident reported on 24 July this year and other minor incidents with intoxicated patients and their families. She says that “most of these incidents happen over the weekends and public holidays, due to the influence of alcohol and they get injured and want to be assisted first when they arrive at casualty”. It is distressing that violence and motor accidents put huge strain on this hospital. The overall damage to society of these injuries is enormous. A broad approach is needed to bring down violent crime and road accidents, much of which is fueled by alcohol. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 25 October 2018
