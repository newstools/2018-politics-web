OPEN LETTER TO: Henk Hugo — DA branch executive Shehana Kajee  DA KwaZulu Natal  Deputy Provincial Chairperson Mike Waters — Deputy Chief Whip, DA  National Assembly Caucus Bronwynn Engelbrecht - National Council of Provinces MP DEMAND FOR AN APOLOGY REGARDING DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS I am writing to you because you re-posted or otherwise distributed an image on social media which made claims about various 'findings" against me by the Auditor- General. In May this year, the Auditor General dismissed the contents as fake. Not only was the AG's signature forged, but his office denied knowing anything about the origins of the document. By re-posting or otherwise distributing the document you published defamatory material regarding me, which is aggravated by the fact that this was done as part of a concerted effort to discredit me for political reasons. Your intentions were vindictive, reckless and very damaging to my reputation. I have instructed my attorneys to commence legal action against you in respect of these defamatory allegations but before doing so would like to afford you all an opportunity to retract same and to apologize to me in public. You have seven days till 18 October 2018 to issue a public apology. Statement issued by Patricia de Lille via Twitter, 11 October 2018
