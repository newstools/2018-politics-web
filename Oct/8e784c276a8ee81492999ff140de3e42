Failing ANC's criminal negligence risks lives of patients 24 October 2018 The Democratic Alliance in the Northern Cape is prepared to take criminal action against the MEC of Health, Fufe Makatong, for the gross negligence of her duties. During an oversight inspection at the Dr Harry Surtie Hospital in Upington today, I discovered that the life of yet another child is being placed at risk due to the lack of emergency medical services. There is only one ambulance operational to serve Upington and the child, who has suffered a serious head injury, needs to be transferred to Kimberley urgently for medical care. There is an ambulance, donated by Kumba Iron Ore, which is ready to transport the patient. But due to administrative delays at the provincial departement, the license has expired and the vehicle does not have the necessary certification. No driver is therefore willing to drive it. And because the department is known as a bad customer and because it routinely fails to settle its debts, private ambulances are unwilling to assist. We have repeatedly tried to contact the MEC through the day to get her assistance. An earlier incident happened where a child requiring emergency transport to Kimberley ultimately died as a result of delays in his care. One death is one too many and the fact that these problems have been allowed to reoccur is a serious violation of our people's rights. The MEC's attitude is a symptom of an uncaring ANC-government which prioritize corruption over the health of our people. If the department of Health was serious about services, we would not see situations where the lives of our children are endangered time and again. Only change under a DA-led government will bring the change needed to speed up the delivery of basic services and to build One South Africa for All.
