EFF WELCOMES RAMAPHOSA'S DECISION TO RELIEVE NENE FROM HIS DUTIES AS FINANCE MINISTER Tuesday, 9 October, 2018 The EFF welcomes the decision by Ramaphosa to remove Nhlanhla Nene from the position of Minister of Finance following his unethical conduct of lying and misleading the public about his relations with the Gupta criminal syndicate. Ramaphosa must apply the same consistency with other ministers who continue to serve in his cabinet like Malusi Gigaba, Nomvula Mokonyane, and Bathabile Dlamini. These ministers have demonstrated the same disregard of ethical conduct shown by Nene, and like Nene they too have undermined parliament's accountability mechanisms. Their continued stay in cabinet sends a message that Ramaphosa is inconsistent and fails to put the interest of South Africans above those of ANC's big shots. We note the appointment of Tito Mboweni as Minister of Finance and impress upon him to prioritize the interests of the people of South Africa, in particular the poor black South Africans who suffer poverty, unemployment and hunger. Highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct must inform anyone who wants to lead South Africa, particularly presiding over the finances of the republic. South Africa must never compromise of this principle, particularly because our state institutions are infested with corruption. Anyone found wanting must be dealt with decisively to draw a solid line against corruption once and for all. Statement issued by the EFF, 9 October 2018
