Julius Malema should appear and give evidence under oath before the Zondo Commission 3 October 2018 The Leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, Julius Malema, has conducted what appears to be a smear campaign against the Minister of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene, alleging that he has played a role in state capture in South Africa. Today, the minister confirmed he had met the Guptas, and although he seems to have exercised poor judgement meeting the Guptas, knowing that they were under investigation by National Treasury for their role in the Estina Dairy Project, he strongly denied he had acted improperly, as deputy finance minister and chairperson of the Public Investment Corporation. Rather than standing on the sidelines sabre rattling, Mr Malema should now have the courage to appear under oath and give evidence relating to his allegations so that they can be properly investigated by the Zondo Commission.
