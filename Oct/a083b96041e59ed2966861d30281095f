BLF’s repeated violent behaviour at Parliament cannot be tolerated 30 October 2018 The DA is dismayed by yet another violent disruption of Parliamentary business by Black Land First (BLF), the second such incident in little over a year. In May 2017, BLF leader Andile Mngxitama and his fellow gang of belligerents was forcefully ejected from a joint meeting of the Finance and Trade and Industry committees. During the melee, Mngxitama referred to Chairperson Joanmariae Fubbs as a “fascist” and got involved in a physical confrontation with Chairperson Yunus Carrim. Today it was the turn of Mngxitama’s toadies who physically confronted a delegation that was invited to present to the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs. I will be writing to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, to ask that the matter be investigated and that the Legislature consider banning the responsible members of the BLF from attending committee meetings and Parliamentary sittings. I will also ask that the Presiding Officers lay criminal charges against those involved, in terms of Section 7 of the Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Parliaments and Provincial Legislatures Act (Act 4 of 2004), failing which I will do so myself. Public participation in the People’s Parliament should be encouraged; however, the BLF’s thuggish behaviour and amateur dramatics should not be tolerated. The important work of Parliament cannot be disrupted due to this irrelevant organisation’s insatiable appetite for attention.
