Statement from the Judging Panel, Taco Kuiper Award for Investigative Journalism Oct 16, 2018 The Sunday Time’s “Cato Manor Hit Squad” story was joint runner-up for the Taco Kuiper Prize for Investigative Journalism in 2013. We note the editor’s admission today that they “committed mistakes [in their reporting] and allowed ourselves to be manipulated by those with ulterior motives”, and their decision to return the prize. We appreciate their honesty in dealing with this. Our panel of judges made the award in good faith. We are deeply disappointed that this entry has now been shown to have fallen short. South Africa has an excellent record of fine investigative journalism and the Awards will continue to support, promote and recognise the best of it and be vigilant in upholding the highest standards.
