Statement on establishment of NDPP appointment panel 14 October 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa has invited a number of legal organisations and independent public institutions to assist him in identifying and selecting individuals for consideration as possible candidates for the position of National Director of Public Prosecutions. The panel will be chaired by Minister Jeff Radebe and will be requested to identify potential candidates, establish that they meet the required criteria, conduct interviews with potential candidates and recommend at least three candidates to the President.

This the President will do after consultation with Minister Michael Masutha. The organisations that have been invited to provide a representative are: - General Council of the Bar of South Africa - Law Society of South Africa - Black Lawyers Association - National Association of Democratic Lawyers - Advocates for Transformation - Auditor-General of South Africa - South African Human Rights Commission The panel will be tasked to complete its work and make recommendations to the President to enable him to meet the deadline set by the Constitutional Court to appoint a new NDPP within 90 court days of 13 August 2018.
