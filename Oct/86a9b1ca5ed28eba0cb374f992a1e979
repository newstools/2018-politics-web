Presidency refers SIU reports to investigated entities 16 October 2018 The President has referred reports on investigations by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) into various government departments and entities to the entities concerned with a request for updates on the implementation of recommendations made by the SIU. The reports concern departments and institutions investigated between 2002 and 2016. The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) is mandated in terms of the Special Investigating Units and Special Tribunal Act 74 of 1996 to investigate serious malpractices or maladministration in connection with the administration of state institutions, state assets and public money as well as any conduct which may seriously harm the interests of the public. The SIU submits a final report to the President upon the conclusion of each investigation conducted. SIU reports include recommendations on interventions such as disciplinary action, criminal prosecution or civil litigation in instances where wrongdoing is identified. Final reports that are currently being shared with parties who have been investigated relate to national government, provincial departments, a number of urban and rural municipalities, as well as state-owned entities including Eskom Holdings Ltd, the South African Broadcasting Corporation and the South African Post Office Ltd, North West municipalities and the national Department of Human Settlements. To ensure that the impact of SIU investigations is felt, the head of the SIU, Advocate Andy Mothibi, the Unitâ€™s management team have reviewed the SIU value chain, in the interest of, among others, improving the turnaround times of investigations. Members of the public are also encouraged to report corruption and to work with the SIU to blow the whistle on corruption by ensuring that where information is available, this is brought forward without fear. This will also ensure that investigations are concluded more speedily. Issued by The Presidency of the Republic of South Africa, 16 October 2018
