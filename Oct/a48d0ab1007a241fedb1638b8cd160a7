Failing ANC in Parliament chooses Ace over Ramaphosa 25 October 2018 The ANC in the National Council of Provinces has today effectively rejected President Ramaphosa's expressed commitment to deal decisively with state capture. This follows a motion by the Democratic Alliance, urging the Free State Legislature to reconsider a recent decision that Ace Magashule, Mamiki Qabathe and Mosebenzi Zwane do not have to appear before a joint committee of inquiry into the looting of millions of Rands from the provincial treasury in the Estina Vrede Dairy Project. The full motion can be found here. The provincial legislature's decision, pushed through by the failing ANC on Monday, effectively prevents members of the legislature from fulfilling their core mandate of holding the provincial executive to account as per their oath of office. By objecting to the DA's motion today, the failing ANC in the NCOP have aligned themselves with the legislature in protecting those implicated in state capture and violated their own oath of office. More so, the falling ANC in the NCOP have voted against President Ramaphosa's promise in favour of Ace Magashule, corruption and those implicated in state capture. It is clear that the culture of defending the indefensible and corrupt has become entrenched in the fibre of the failing ANC on all levels. Only the DA can bring change that builds One South Africa for All, where corruption is stopped and those found to be corrupt are jailed. Issued by George Michalakis, DA Member of NCOP, 25 October 2018
