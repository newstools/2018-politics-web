Media Statement issued by the South African Police Service 23 October 2018 Two men allegedly responsible for the killing of two security guards last week in Gauteng were shot and killed by police during early hours of this morning. Members from the Gauteng Organised Crime Unit, acting on intelligence and supported by various other police units, were led to a shack in the Clermont area, West of Durban. When police tried to arrest the two suspects, Lindokuhle Cebekhulu (24) and Mbuyiselo Mthonti (26) they resisted which resulted in both suspects being shot dead. There are no reports of any police officers being injured at this stage. On 10 October 2018 the two security guards were murdered while seated in their patrol vehicle in the Moroka are before their firearms were taken from them. This incident was captured on video which went viral sparking widespread condemnation by various sectors of society. Crime Intelligence and Gauteng Organised Crime Unit worked tirelessly over these past two weeks to track down the culprits. A handgun, which was recovered at the scene will be sent for ballistic testing to establish if it was the weapon used in the killing of the guards as well as if it was used in the commission of any other crimes.
