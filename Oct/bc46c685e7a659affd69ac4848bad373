NUM Western Cape Region is worried by the reckless statement made by the Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on ESKOM's looming retrenchments. 22 October 2018 The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in Western Cape Region is angered and disturbed by the reckless statement made by the Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni on the ESKOM's looming retrenchments. The NUM is of the view that there are  labour laws in this country that must be respected by all including the Minister of Finance. To announce the possibility of reducing numbers without consulting the unions that are organizing in that sector is unlawful and reckless. The NUM Western Cape believes that the problem of ESKOM does not have a bloated structure. ESKOM’s bigger problem amongst others is the Power Purchase Agreements that were signed by the government. The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers (REIPPs) are milking ESKOM. ESKOM is buying Electricity from the REIPPs by R2.14 and sell it at 89 cents. This arrangement is clearly unsustainable. The Minister of Finance must deal with this issue before destroying jobs in ESKOM. The fairytale that ESKOM is bloated is a narrative from the people who want to privatize ESKOM. There is no scientific proof that ESKOM is bloated. The minister must further deal with the issue of the municipal debts. ESKOM is owed more than 13 billion by the municipalities. The minister must come with a strategy to assist ESKOM to get this money from the municipalities before he issues reckless and unfounded statements. ESKOM does not have to retrench 30 000 employees. ESKOM needs all its employees. The ESKOM structure is based on its business needs. If ESKOM wants to restructure its business, it must follow the requirements of the law. ESKOM must consult the trade unions as it is required by law. Issued by Khangela Baloyi, NUM Western Cape Eskom Full-Time Shop Steward, 22 October 2018
