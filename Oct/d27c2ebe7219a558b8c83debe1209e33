Omotoso trial: Judge rejects bid to appeal ruling over whether he should recuse himself 30 October 2018 The judge in the rape trial of Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso has dismissed an application for leave to appeal a ruling that he recuse himself from presiding over the trial. Judge Mandela Makaula on Tuesday rejected the pastor's legal team's request to appeal his ruling last week, where he rejected their request that he recuse himself. The defence claimed Makaula had acted in a biased manner towards their client. On Tuesday, the judge said presiding over a case was not a game. "It's not about a win or a lose, it is about justice," said Makaula. Defence advocate Peter Daubermann has asked the court for postponement of the matter, in order to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). Makaula postponed the matter pending the resolution of those applications. The matter has been postponed to December 10, 2018. This is a developing story. News24
