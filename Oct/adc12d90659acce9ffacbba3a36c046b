City no longer opposes Maiden’s Cove review application The City of Cape Town has, after careful consideration and taking into account the concerns raised by the broader public, decided to withdraw its opposition to the review application brought by a number of litigants in the Western Cape High Court. Read more below: On 3 April 2018 the Bungalow Owners’ Association and Others filed an application in the Western Cape High Court, asking the court to review and set aside the City’s decision to sell and lease the City-owned land between the Clifton bungalows and Camps Bay. To date, the City has opposed the review application. The application is against a proposed development at Maiden’s Cove, as the Clifton Precinct is also known. However, over the past months we have taken note of the concerns raised by residents, non-profit organisations, and others. These concerns relate to the impact the proposed development could have on Maiden’s Cove, and how it could affect those who frequently visit the area. We have heard their pleas, read their letters and opinion pieces, and reflected on their arguments. The City has subsequently, and after consulting senior counsel, decided against opposing the review application. The effect will be that the review application will proceed unopposed by the City. The City has informed the developer accordingly earlier today, 12 October 2018 of the decision and is in discussion with it. We are committed to working together with our residents in devising a vision for one of Cape Town’s most inclusive and valued public spaces. Statement issued by Councillor Stuart Diamond, Mayoral Committee Member for Assets and Facilities Management, City of Cape Town, 12 October 2018
