DA welcomes Hlongwa resignation but prosecution must follow 30 October 2018 The Democratic Alliance welcomes the resignation of Brian Hlongwa as ANC Gauteng Chief Whip. This follows sustained pressure by the DA. This is long overdue and is no doubt due to the ANC feeling vulnerable because of the upcoming elections. According to the DA’s Hlongwa Monitor, it is 126 days since the SIU report which revealed Hlongwa’s involvement in R1.2 billion corruption when he was Health MEC from 2006 to 2009. But there were many previous disclosures that implicated him in horrendous corruption which continues to cripple the Gauteng Health Department. He has been protected for a long time and it is disgraceful that he served so long in a senior ANC position despite the corruption cloud over his head. It reflects badly on Premier David Makhura who should have acted against him far sooner. Hlongwa must now be prosecuted without delay in a court of law and be punished for his misdeeds. Only the DA can bring change to Gauteng and build One South Africa for all, where corruption is stopped. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 30 October 2018
