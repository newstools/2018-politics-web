EFF CALLS ON RAMAPHOSA TO FIRE GIGABA FROM CABINET FOR LYING UNDER OATH Wednesday, 31 October 2018 The EFF welcomes Public Protector's finding that Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba violated the Constitution and Executive Ethics Code when he told an "untruth under oath" during the Fireblade Aviation court battle. This ruling means Gigaba is a serious menace to the constitution, and the rule of law. Nothing is worse than lying under oath. The Public Protector has this recommended that President Ramaphosa must take appropriate action. We cannot think of any more appropriate action to take against anyone who lies under oath than removal from office. The EFF has long said that like Zuma, Gigaba must no longer hold any public office, including being a Member of Parliament. In addition, the affording of a private terminal to the Oppenheimers is not only unpatriotic, but a serious threat to national security. Gigaba lied and also put our national security at risk. This is the same as Zuma who put national security under threat at Waterkloof Airforce Military base when he made it available for Guptas, the same Guptas that Gigaba suspiciously afforded citizenship. The EFF reiterates that he must be fired with immediate effect. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 31 October 2018
