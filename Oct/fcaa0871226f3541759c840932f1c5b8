DA calls on SABC to reveal top management salaries 2 October 2018 In a statement yesterday, the SABC stated that “we would like to place on record that the salaries of the recently appointed executive board members and executive management have been significantly reduced...” However, the “significantly reduced” salaries are not revealed. This follows a request I made for the SABC’s top management to undergo a process of salary review based on the extraordinarily high salaries the SABC’s top management earned in the 2016/17 financial year. Most of the salaries were highly inflated, a legacy of Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s irregular annual salary increases. I also requested that top management take salary cuts, where necessary, in solidarity with SABC staff who have been asked to implement austerity measures. In order to play open cards with the public, we call on the SABC to reveal its top management salaries from GCEO down to Group Executives. This is not confidential information, as the SABC is a public institution and their salaries are a matter of public record. In order to ease concerns that the upper echelons of the SABC continue to live the high life, while staff face the possibility of retrenchment, the SABC must reveal the salaries for public scrutiny and to confirm that austerity measures do apply across the SABC. We trust that the SABC will, in the public interest, reveal this information. Issued by Phumzile Van Damme, DA Shadow Minister of Communications, 2 September 2018
