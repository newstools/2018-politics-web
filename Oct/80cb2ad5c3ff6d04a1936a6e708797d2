ANC fails to keep Westbury residents safe 1 October 2018 Today residents of Westbury have once again blockaded roads into the area following the death of a woman in an alleged gang-related shooting. A child was also wounded in the shooting. Residents of Westbury say they have had enough of the rising levels of crime in the area. Today’s action by the community shows that they are fed up with the failing ANC government and that they are desperate for change, which restores order and keeps the people safe. The community has called on provincial government to investigate the alleged complicity of police with those responsible for the ongoing violence in the area. JPMD has already increased the number of Metro Police Officers in the area to help fight crime, yet SAPS' visibility has not increased. It is high time that residents are given an honest, professional and well-resourced police service that is not corrupt, uncaring and colluding with gangsters and drug dealers. Provincial government has a duty to protect the citizens of Gauteng from crime and criminals. Freedom and security are guaranteed under the Constitution, but the ANC-led government is failing to implement effective measures to ensure this. It is clear that SAPS is not doing enough to curb crime in the area. It is clear that the residents of Westbury have lost faith in the police as the ANC is failing in its mandate to keep residents safe. The DA is calling on the MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane to liaise with Provincial Police Commissioner, Lieutenant-General, Deliwe de Lange to send in the tactical response unit to assist with policing in the area, especially to fight crimes related to gangsterism and drugs. I will be meeting with community leaders of Westbury in due course to engage with them on their concerns around crime in the area.
