Lesufi’s “backlog” creates tension in Gauteng 22 October 2018 The fact that the MEC for Education in Gauteng, Mr Panyaza Lesufi, has fallen behind with his work is creating unnecessary tension between the Gauteng Department of Education and schools in the province. In May 2016, the Constitutional Court instructed the MEC to see to it that new feeder zones for schools are identified in consultation with each school in the province. This instruction was given as part of the ruling in the court case between the MEC and the Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools (Fedsas).  Even though the Department has had two years in which to complete the process, schools were only informed of it in the last two weeks. And now schools only have one month to comment on the new feeder zones. The FF Plus in Gauteng laments Mr Lesufi's recent actions and would like to point out that less than three months ago, with the election of Lesufi as the deputy chairperson of the ANC in Gauteng, the FF Plus warned that schools in Gauteng have a hard time ahead of them. Lesufi no longer focuses all his attention on his job as MEC and his divided attention is what caused this predicament. At present, Lesufi's attention is focused on politics in the province and not on his Department. The FF Plus considers Lesufi's latest actions to be unfair, merciless and selfish. Should he try to implement the new feeder zones without first properly consulting with all the schools, it will be the last nail in the Gauteng Department of Education's coffin and chaos will ensue in all Gauteng schools.
