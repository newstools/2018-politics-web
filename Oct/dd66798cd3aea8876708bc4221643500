EFF STATEMENT ON THE BARBARIC CROSS EXAMINATION OF CHERYL ZONDI Wednesday, 17 October 2018 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) notes with disdain and mortifications, the barbaric cross examination of Cheryl Zondi in the rape case of the accused Timothy Omotoso by his lawyer Peter Daubermann. The Chief Justice must transform the dehumanizing and demeaning manner in which victims of sexual violence are mistreated in the court room. The dehumanizing forms of cross examination contribute in the protection and perpetuation of toxic patriarchal masculinity. This is because once men rape they know many women will not stomach being humiliated through cross examination processes at the court. As a result, the country is unable to hold rapists accountable and punish them. We reiterate our condemnation of advocate Peter Daubermann's barbaric ways of cross examination. Witnesses, even if in the end the case is not in their favor, they still must be afforded the respect of any and all human beings. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 17 October 2018
