Sasol turns a deaf ear to the voice of striking workers 3 October 2018 Solidarity and Sasol today left a meeting at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) without achieving any success after the second round of conciliation held at the CCMA did not yield a solution for the ongoing dispute. Solidarity members at Sasol have been on a go-slow since the beginning of September because of Sasol’s employee ownership plan, Khanyisa, which excludes white workers from its Phase 2. According to Solidarity Deputy General Secretary Deon Reyneke, Sasol refuses to whatsoever concede to the striking workers’ requests. “Sasol maintains in no uncertain terms that its division of the workforce on the basis of race is acceptable and constitutes justified discrimination. The striking workers’ clear request for inclusivity is simply being swept off the table,” Reyneke explained. Solidarity will now intensify the strike and the creation of awareness about this important issue by declaring a national day of protest by its members and by organising a protest march to the Sasol Head Office in Sandton. Full details of the protest march will soon be announced. Issued by Deon Reyneke, Deputy General Secretary, Solidarity, 3 October 2018
