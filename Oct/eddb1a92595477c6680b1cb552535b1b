Premier Makhura condemns attacks on AGSA official in Emfuleni Local Municipality 16 October 2018 Premier David Makhura has expressed strong condemnation for the violent attack of an official of the Office of the Auditor General in Emfuleni Local Municipality. The Office of the Premier regards this incident as one that not only violates the basic human rights that should be afforded to all persons in South Africa, but one which hinders the work of the Auditor General. While the motive of the crime is unknown at this stage, the Gauteng Provincial Government views such an incident in a very serious light and has urged the South African Police Service (SAPS) to hunt down the attackers and ensure that they face the full might of the law. The Gauteng Government is working closely with the Office of the Auditor-General to ensure the safety of the team of auditors who are currently conducting audits in Emfuleni Local Municipality. Premier Makhura urges all officials to report all incidents, including those of threats or suspicious assertions immediately so that prompt action can be taken. The Premier wishes the injured official a speedy recovery. Issued byÂ Thabo Masebe, Spokesperson for the Gauteng Provincial Government, 16 October 2018
