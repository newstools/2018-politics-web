DA calls for terms of Public Enterprises DG’s settlement to be made public The DA will write to President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask that the terms of the settlement, reportedly between public enterprises director-general, Richard Seleke, and the Presidency, to be made public. It has now been confirmed that Mr. Seleke has left the department, but nothing has been said of the exact reasons or the terms of the settlement. Mr. Seleke’s name has been linked to State Capture and is contained in the Gupta leaked emails. Specifically, that he gave key information on Denel to the Guptas’. It is well known that the state capture project, headed up by the Gupta’s and with the help of the ANC, stole billions from South Africans and has directly compromised the future of the country. It is very important that those who had a hand in giving the Gupta’s access to the public purse are exposed, fully investigated, and face the full might of the law for their actions. Allowing Mr. Seleke to leave, without letting the public know why would compromise this critical objective and cannot be allowed to stand.
