City Power robbery – Mashaba calls on public to help arrest criminals 21 October 2018 City Power has opened a case of theft following an armed robbery at its substation in Mulbarton, south of Johannesburg. Yesterday, six (6) armed men stormed the substation at around midnight, and held up the security officers on duty and a staff member, tied them with cable ties, before stealing valuable equipment from the site. Mulbarton substation is undergoing a major upgrade and is currently under a contractor and guarded by the contractor. The six robbers arrived in a truck and overpowered the two security guards on duty. They proceeded to break into the onsite storage and loaded a 500 metre drum of cable, and 5 x 75m copper cables. While busy, City Power electrician who was working on an outage in Glenvista arrived at the substation trying to trace the outage fault. He was also held and tied up. The three were also robbed of three cellphones. The electrician was also robbed of his R3500 worth of his work toolbox. Police were called and a case of armed robbery has been opened at Mondeor Police station. We cannot allow criminals to threaten the delivery of services in our City. I encourage anyone with information about this crime to visit the Mondeor Police or City Power Risk Control on 011 490 7900.
