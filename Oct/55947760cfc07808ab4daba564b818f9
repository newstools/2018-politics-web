FF Plus welcomes the action taken against Brian Hlongwa, ANC chief whip in Gauteng Legislature 30 October 2018 Today, the FF Plus in Gauteng welcomed the ANC's announcement that their Chief Whip in the Gauteng Legislature, Brian Hlongwa, has vacated his position. Hlongwa resigned from the ANC due to his involvement in various corrupt activities while he was the MEC for Health in Gauteng. Hlongwa was implicated in corruption of R1,2 billion in a special investigation unit's report. The corruption caused the Department of Health in Gauteng to grind to a complete standstill and it also gave rise to the Esidimeni tragedy. The FF Plus wants to emphasise that Hlongwa's resignation today indicates that he is guilty, and he will not get away with it. The FF Plus has already prepared criminal charges and will soon report the matter to the SAPS for further investigation. The FF Plus was part of the group of opposition parties that tabled a motion of no confidence in Hlongwa in the Gauteng Legislature on the 28th of July 2018. Hlongwa survived the motion with only three votes. The FF Plus and other opposition parties also held a protest march against Hlongwa and Qedani Mahlangu, the former MEC for Health in Gauteng, in August 2018 outside the Legislature. The FF Plus reaffirms that the party has a policy of zero tolerance with regards to corruption and crime. The FF Plus will also see to it that Brian Hlongwa gets the punishment he deserves. Brian Hlongwa's resignation today is not only a victory for the FF Plus and other opposition parties, but also for the people who passed away as a result of the Esidimeni tragedy and numerous mysterious deaths in hospitals.
