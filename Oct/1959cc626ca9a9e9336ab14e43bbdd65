DA in Western Cape must Convene media brief and Apologize on DAFF DDG issues 1 October 2018 As the Ministry we have noted the statement by a DA MPL who has been obsessed about DAFF issues, especially Fisheries developments relying on on the so-called sources as a basis for her outlandish public claims. As the Ministry we were extremely shocked by this juvenile play to the gallery on what was unknown to us, the custodian of the process against Miss Ndudane. To the extent that this MPL convened a press conference on such unfounded claims thereby compromising our own process without solicitation, we demand a similar press conference to be convened to withdraw and apologize. She must also apologize to the Minister whose name featured very strongly in her statement for which he stands insulted. The National Minister of DAFF accounts to the Portfolio Committee of DAFF where DA is represented not in some provincial Legislature. In fact Fisheries component of DAFF is a national competency with no provincial concurrency. We have been noting with grave concerns some statements and media commentary from that province on fisheries matters for which they have no locus standi for their preoccupation. This conduct has been injudicious to the extreme. We hope it ends here. Issued by Khaye Nkwanyana, Spokesperson for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry , 1 October 2018
