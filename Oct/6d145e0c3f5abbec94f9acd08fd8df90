Arrest of police officers involved in alleged killing of TUT student a step closer to justice 22 October 2018 The arrest of two police officers who allegedly shot and killed Katlego Monareng, a student at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) during the Student Representative Council (SRC) elections dispute, is a step towards justice and emphasises our call for an honest and professional police service. The tragic incident happened in August at the Soshanguve campus in Tshwane. This follows allegations that an employee of IEFSA- the company selected by TUT to run the SRC elections illegally - removed a ballot box from the voting station. These allegations fuelled a violent rampage by the students. Monareng was killed in the crossfire between SAPS and protesting ANC and EFF students. The DA applauds the swift investigation and arrest of the two police officers involved by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). This is an example of the type of police service which we so desperately need – one that is honest and professional. Where the police are found culpable in using excessive force they must face the full might of the law. Members of the Democratic Alliance Students’ Organisation (DASO) will tomorrow picket outside the Soshanguve Magistrate Court where the officers will appear on a charge of murder. A DA government is committed to ensuring that our police service is honest, professional and effective in fighting crime. Issued by Solly Msimanga, DA Gauteng Premier Candidate, 22 October 2018
