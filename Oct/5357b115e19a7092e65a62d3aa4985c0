EFF STATEMENT ON FAKE NEWS REGARGING DYAMBEU INVESTMENTS AND CIC JULIUS MALEMA Sunday, 14 October, 2018 The EFF CIC Julius Malema has been accused by agents of mass deception that he owns 47% of Dyambeu Investments linked to VBS Mutual Bank. One of these agents was the gullible DA MP Ghaleb Cachalia who made such allegations of the social media platform, specifically, Twitter. Upon a letter threatening to take legal action against his defamatory, false and deceptive allegations, Ghaleb Cachalia withdrew his allegations which were posted as fact. This is proof of a well-orchestrated propaganda campaign to discredit and tarnish the good and reputable name of the EFF. The white dominated media has also been party to this mass deception campaign with the aim of discrediting the EFF by falsely defaming its leaders. We are not only unshaken but remain focused and strong in the face of all these weapons of mass deception. No one, no matter how powerful will succeed against the EFF and its inevitable ability to hold the powerful accountable. We remain the only organization able to shake both white monopoly capital agents and liberation movements kleptocrats. We call on all society to be alert of all the false and fake news spread by many credible media platforms and so called respectable individuals like Cachalia.
