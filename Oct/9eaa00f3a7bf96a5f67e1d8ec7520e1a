DA leadership will support the victims of the Khayelitsha fire Note to editors: Please click here for a soundbite by the DA Western Cape Premier Candidate, Alan Winde. "The DA wishes to extend its deepest condolences to all the victims of this horrific fire and will continue to support the community in any way possible." Today, Saturday 20 October, DA Western Cape Provincial Leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, Premier Candidate Alan Winde, Nceba Hinana MPP, Metro Regional Chairperson, Grant Twigg, Councillor Anda Ntsodo, DAWN Regional Chairperson, Ncumisa Mahangu and a number of our DA councillors visited the site in Khayelitsha where a devastating fire has left hundreds of people destitute. The fire occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning amidst strong winds in the Cape. Sadly one person has lost his life in the fire with more than 200 homes destroyed. The victims of the fire will be temporarily accommodated at nearby community centres and churches. Madikizela has urged residents to allow government to service the site before new structures are erected. We commend the quick response by the City of Cape Town Firefighters and the Western Cape Disaster Management team. It was also heartening to see the local DA structures on site from early this morning helping victims to remove the rubble and assist the victims wherever they can. The DA wishes to extend its deepest condolences to all the victims of this horrific fire and will continue to support the community in any way possible. We call on residents of Cape Town to help our fellow citizens by contributing to the victims. Donations can be dropped off at the fire station in Khayelitsha.
