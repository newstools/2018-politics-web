KPMG statement in relation to Nedbank Group Limited and Nedbank Limited’s announcement of change of auditor 29 October 2018 KPMG South Africa notes the announcement today from Nedbank Group Limited and Nedbank Limited that the firm will be rotated off as its external auditor. The decision is part of the industry wide move towards mandatory audit firm rotation, which seeks to ensure objectivity and robust auditing services are provided to all public interest entities. Going forward, this will likely involve a higher degree of change among established auditing relationships than we have been used to. Executive Chairman of KPMG SA, Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu said: “It is always disappointing to lose a client, but we remain very proud of the work that we have performed for Nedbank over many years, and of the diligence and professionalism of the team who served them. KPMG itself is a very different business from a year ago, as we have implemented far reaching changes to all aspects of the firm including; governance and leadership, the client roster, quality as well as culture and ethics. I am confident we are taking the right steps and that this is being recognised by clients. Our readmission earlier this month to membership of BLSA was a welcome recognition of the changes we are making and has bolstered our determination to continue taking all measures to restore trust in the firm.” Issued by Nqubeko Sibiya, Communications Manager, Marketing and Communications, KPMG Services (Proprietary) Limited, 29 October 2018
