2 cops arrested in connection with TUT student's death 22 October 2018 The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) has arrested two police officers in connection with the death of a Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student. Katlego Monareng was shot dead during the Student Representative Council (SRC) elections at the Soshanguve campus in August. IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini said at the time that police had said that they had been called to the scene after a presiding officer was allegedly held hostage and assaulted by students. As police headed out, about 200 students had barricaded the entrance of the campus. Dlamini said the students also stoned the police vehicles. "The police reported that they fired at the ground with R5 rifles, and that when they left, no one was injured, but police vehicles were damaged. The police were later informed that a student had been shot and injured," Dlamini said. Monareng died on the way to hospital. Dlamini said in a statement on Monday that a constable and a captain were facing murder charges following their arrests. "The IPID has concluded its investigation; only two technical reports are outstanding," he said. The two officers will appear at the Soshanguve Magistrate's Court on October 23. News24
