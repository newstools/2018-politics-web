DA Gauteng leadership backs Mayor Msimanga 23 October 2018 The DA rejects media reports around the replacement of Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga. The party’s leadership in Gauteng has full confidence in Mayor Msimanga and his ability to execute his duties as Mayor, while still being the party’s Premier Candidate for Gauteng. The DA rejects the rumour that the Mayor is under investigation and has been forced to take special leave. These reports are empty rumours and speculative in the extreme. These have no bearing on the truth. Indeed, we place on record once again that no such decision has been taken Issued by DA Gauteng Leadership, 23 October 2018
