120 Babies got deadly infection in Gauteng hospitals 23 October 2018 Eight state hospitals in Gauteng have had 120 cases of babies infected with Necrotising Enterocolitis (NEC) this year, but all of them survived. Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said this today in an oral reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. NEC is a medical condition where a portion of the bowel dies, and typically occurs in newborns that are either premature or otherwise unwell. Ramokgopa said that causes were multi-factorial and predisposing factors included premature birth and smoking during pregnancy. The following hospitals were affected: Rahima Moosa - 51 casesPholosong - still being verifiedChris Hani Baragwanath - 48 casesSteve Biko - 9 casesKalafong - 1 caseJubilee - 2 casesSebokeng - 1 caseTambo Memorial - 8 cases According to Ramokgopa, there is a 30% fatality NEC fatality rate globally, and she praised staff who successfully saved the lives of NEC-infected babies. I am concerned that Ramokgopa did not confirm the 9 NEC deaths at the Rahima Moosa Hospital reported by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) earlier this year. It is very disturbing that Rahima Moosa Hospital has the most NEC cases as the hospital is struggling with severe staff shortages and overcrowded conditions. I have requested the SA Human Rights Commission to inspect this hospital as I distrust the Gauteng Health Department which has covered up avoidable baby deaths in the past.
