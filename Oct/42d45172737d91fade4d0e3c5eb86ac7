De Lille approves R4.5m for festive lights switch-on event 17 October 2018 Outgoing Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille has approved a budget of R4.5m for the city's annual switching on of the festive lights, which sees residents and tourists gathering for performances to mark the start of the festive season. De Lilleâ€™s spokesperson Zara Nicholson told News24 that the amount was recommended by the City's special events committee and that funding would come from its events department. "The costs are for logistical requirements such as fencing, toilets, a stage, sound, big screens to cover the extended footprint on the Grand Parade and into Darling Street," she said. The Safety at Sports and Recreational Events Act dictated the level of logistics required to stage an event on this scale, she added. In recent years, the event has attracted between 80 000 and 100 000 people from surrounding areas and abroad. The theme this year is "Cape Town, City of Inspiration", celebrating former president Nelson Mandela's centenary. "The event is a tradition in Cape Town, hosted to thank residents for working with the City and to usher in the festive season. It is a free open-air concert and family event which is a highlight for many people," said Nicholson. Last year's event included performances by Jimmy Nevis, Vicky Sampson, Freshlyground and Koos Kombuis. "Many families who are otherwise not able to afford to see some of their favourite artists at other concerts look forward to this event, where they get to see the very best talent for free and spend an enjoyable day with family and friends."
