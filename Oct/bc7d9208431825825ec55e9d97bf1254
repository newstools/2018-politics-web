EXECUTIVE CHAOS Discontinuity in the National Executive: 2009-2018 October 2018 Introduction This document comprises two sections. Section A: The Facts — sets out the evidence regarding the turmoil in the National Executive. Secondly, all the information in the document is drawn from Annexure A, which can be found at the end of this document and comprises an overview of all 14 Na- tional Executives between 10 May 2009 and 9 October 2018. Ideally, from an African National Congress (ANC) perspective, the period 2009-2018 would have comprised two terms under President Jacob Zuma and, in turn, relative continuity (there will inevitably be some changes that have to be made to the executive from time to time). One of the beneﬁts of hav- ing both a large majority and a two-term President is a stable national administration and the chance for its members to build up time, experience and a consolidated team in a given portfolio. However, it has instead been a period marked by profound turmoil and dramatic and frequent change, with some time to go still until the next national and provincial election in 2019. Summary There have been 14 reconstituted National Executives since 10 May 2009. The average National Execu- tive lasts 245 days (or 165 working days) until it is reconstituted. The longest lasted 540 days (or 372 working days). The shortest lasted just 5 days (or 3 working days). There are 8 National Executives that have lasted less than 200 working days and 4 that have lasted less than 100 working days. There have been 164 changes made to the National Executive since 2009. A total of 94 changes have been made to ministerial positions (including 1 to the position of President) and 70 changes to Deputy Ministerial positions (including 2 to the position of Deputy President). In total, 129 people have served as either a Minister or Deputy Minister since 2009. Some 57 people who once served in either of those positions are no longer part of the National Executive. By the time his second term started, Jacob Zuma’s Cabinet retention rate was just 28% (compared to 52% for former President Thabo Mbeki). Of the 64 members selected to the National Executive on 10 May 2009, 37 (or 58%) are no longer part of the Executive and only 7 (11%) retain their original positions. Only 1 ministry — basic education — boasts an unchanged Minister and Deputy Minister since 2009. By contrast, the Ministry of Communications has had 8 dif- ferent Ministers and 5 diﬀerent Deputy Ministers (The average Communications Minister serves for 430 days or 294 working days before being reshuﬄed). Deﬁnitions This document looks at the extent and nature of the changes made to the 14 National Executives that have held oﬃce between 10 May 2009 (the ﬁrst) and 9 October 2018 (the fourteenth). The National Executive comprises the President, the Deputy President, all Ministers and all Deputy Ministers. It should be distinguished from the Cabinet, which comprises the President, Deputy President and all Ministers. Changes to the National Executive are done at the discretion of the President. The current National Executive (as of 9 October 2018) comprises 72 members, including the Presi- dent, the Deputy President, 34 Ministers and 36 Deputy Ministers, who oversee 37 diﬀerent ministries. There are, however, 77 positions in the current National Executive, 5 of which are vacant. The National Executive has grown signiﬁcantly since the ﬁrst (10 May 2009). Back then, it com- prised 64 members. That is, the President, the Deputy President, 34 Ministers and 28 Deputy Ministers, who oversaw 34 diﬀerent ministries. There were, however, 69 positions in the ﬁrst National Executive, 5 of which were left vacant. This analysis concerns the two ﬁve-year terms under President Jacob Zuma, which ideally would have run from 2009 to 2018, but which were interrupted late into the second term by the election of Cyril Ramaphosa as ANC President and, later, as South Africa’s President, on 14 February 2018. Nevertheless, Ramaphosa does not enjoy a public mandate and, given that the point and beneﬁt of having a two-term President is continuity — and with it experience and knowledge in a given position — it is reasonable to assess the two terms as one. Finally, while some of these ‘reshuﬄes’ are extensive, and others minimal, even small changes can be deeply signiﬁcant, as South Africa found out on 9 December 2015 when President Zuma removed Nhlanhla Nene from his position as Finance Minister.

The retention rate - Jacob Zuma’s ﬁrst Executive (10 May 2009) comprised 64 members: the President, the Deputy Presi- dent, 34 Ministers and 28 Deputy Ministers, who oversaw 34 diﬀerent ministries. By comparing the number of Ministers who held the same position when he constituted his ﬁrst Cabinet for his second administration (his seventh Executive in all, on 25 May 2014), it is possible to determine the reten- tion rate. We can use the same former President’s ﬁrst-term Cabinet and his Cabinet at the start of his second term, for the purposes of comparison. Those ministries that were restructured have been excluded.
