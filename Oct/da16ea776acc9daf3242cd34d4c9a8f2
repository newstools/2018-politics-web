Another delay in top ANC leader's trial over failed Durban North Sea Jazz Festival 16 October 2018 ANC heavyweight Mike Mabuyakhulu made another brief appearance in Durban's Commercial Crime Court on Tuesday on charges of money laundering and corruption relating to R28m allegedly paid for a North Sea Jazz Festival in Durban in 2012 which never took place. Mabuyakhulu was arrested earlier this year along with seven others. Mabuyakhulu, his co-accused and their companies are collectively facing 77 charges. But the case is going nowhere fast. On Tuesday, it was postponed until February 2019 for the State to respond to more requests for further particulars to the charge sheet. Mabuyakhulu's co-accused are Ceaser Walter Mkhize, Mabheleni Ntuli, Mzwandile Basil Ninela, Nonhlanhla Brenda Ninela, Nothando Lorraine Zungu, Ntokozo Ndlovu and Njabulo Mbongwe Mkhize. The companies involved are Desmond Khalid Golding, DMD Capital PTY LTD, Ishashalazi Production CC, Ishinga Holdings, Maqhoboza Traders CC, Shaka Holdings, Soft Skills Communications 100 CC and Supersize Investment 20CC. It is alleged that they were paid for their services, even though the event was cancelled. At a previous court appearance, Mabuyakhulu's advocate Jimmy Howse said he was only facing six of the 77 charges, involving R300 000, and suggested that his case should be separated from the rest. He asked for a "swift response" to the request for further particulars. On Tuesday, he agreed to the adjournment until next year. News24
