Further Baaitjies-trial delays, a failure of justice 16 October 2018 The Democratic Alliance notes the latest postponement in the Johannes Baaitjies-trial. Proceedings were halted and postponed until Thursday to allow for one of the accused to get clarity on his request for additional legal representation from Legal Aid. Inasmuch as we respect the right to a fair trial, it is becoming increasingly clear that the accused are playing delaying tactics. The chopping and changing of legal teams is just one of the latest in a set of manoeuvres to delay their ultimate accountability for the brutal murder of Johannes Baaitjies. Baaitjies was kidnapped and murdered, along with his business partner, shortly before his inauguration as a councilor in the Kgatelopele Local Municipality. We want these proceedings to start on Thursday, as it is important for the Baaitjies-family and the broader DA-family to get closure in this painful matter. We will continue to demand justice for our colleague. Issued by Andrew Louw, DA Northern Cape Premier Candidate, 16 October 2018
