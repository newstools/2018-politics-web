COSATU statement on Pastor Omotoso trial 18 October 2018 The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) has noted with concern the proceedings in the trial of Omotoso, the alleged perpetrator of grievous acts of sexual violence and statutory rape of about 40 South African women who were members of his church. COSATU is appalled that the alleged perpetrator expected to get away with such a gross violation of young women and girls. We are calling on all ethical congregants and Omotoso’s wife to desist from intimidating witnesses in full view of the Court. We are calling on any of those who are involved in intimidation tactics to be apprehended by the police. COSATU believes that structural violence is too endemic in South Africa to an extent that women and especially young women are unsafe even in places of worship. The federation condemns the abuse of power by some men of the cloth and some others who are in positions of authority. We are shocked at the manner that evidence is being led in the Port Elizabeth High Court. The justice system has once again proven that women’s rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution of South Africa are being squandered in the gender blind and gender insensitive judicial processes. We are calling on the judicial fraternity to do an introspection of their processes and correct themselves in the process of defending their clients and eliciting justice for GBV survivors. COSATU applauds the manner in which the survivor, Cheryl, has handled herself under such trying circumstances and thank her for the example she has set for all GBV survivors to stand up for themselves. We are also calling on our members in the Eastern Cape Province to support the survivors of this violation by the alleged perpetrator who is a disappointment to many as a man who ought to have been trustworthy. ZERO TOLERANCE FOR GBV! DOWN WITH GBV! DOWN! Issued Sizwe Pamla, National Spokesperson, COSATU, 18 October 2018
