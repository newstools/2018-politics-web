With government officials like Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane, tax payers have reason to question why they have to pay taxes The ignorant and aggressive behaviour displayed by the head of SARS's IT Department, Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane, in front of the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into state capture and during a television interview is illustrative of the ANC's policy of cadre deployment by means of Affirmative Action (AA), which is the main reason why our public service is failing. It should compel tax payers to ask themselves why they are financing this circus of a government. It is ironic that the ANC itself does not even comply with the Constitution's prescriptions for Affirmative Action which determine that, in broad terms, it should be representative of the population – which is of course in line with the ANC's policy of "representation". In an answer to a parliamentary question posed by the FF Plus, it became clear that black people are over-represented while minority groups are under-represented in the public service. The ANC, however, is not interested in rectifying this and will apparently only be satisfied with a 100% cadre-deployed labour force in the public service. Seeing as tax payers have already reached the Laffer Curve's point of resistance – as is evident in the boycott of the Gauteng e-toll system – it will come as no surprise if tax payers are even less willing to pay money to the government in the future.  ****  Statement issued by Adv.
