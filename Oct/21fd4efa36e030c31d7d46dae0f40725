Failing ANC has forgotten the youth 31 October 2018 The latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey once again shows that the failing ANC cannot open fair access to real and long-term jobs for the youth of the Northern Cape. The Northern Cape continues to have the highest unemployment rate among the youth, which sustains a cycle of poverty and poor conditions for future generations. The failing has forgotten about people oppressed by poverty and unemployment. During my Listening Tour in Upington and Namakwaland the past two weeks, I met with many young people who are eager and desperate for work. They want to roll up their sleeves and use their qualifications for the benefit of their communities, but are being denied the opportunity to do so. Unemployment oppresses our youth and they have no fair access to jobs. The failing ANC government clearly only cares about enriching themselves and expanding a patronage network for the politically connected. The DA is the only party with a plan to create fair access to real and long-term jobs, which we implement where we govern. Through skills development programmes, job centers which provide a broad range of support to job-seekers, increased assistance to SMMEs and the removal of red tape we can create far more opportunities for our youth. We also believe in prosecuting the practice of carpet interviews and eliminating sex for jobs, which robs our young women of dignity. Only change under a DA-led government can bring fair access to real jobs for our youth. Issued by Andrew Louw, DA Northern Cape Premier Candidate, 31 October 2018
