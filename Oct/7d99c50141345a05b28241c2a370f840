Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina survives another no confidence vote 25 October 2018 The ANC in Ekurhuleni and its coalition partners have defeated a second motion of no confidence against Mayor Mzwandile Masina. There was no secret ballot on Thursday as council speaker Patricia Khumalo put the question to the house, and the majority responded no. The motion was tabled by the DA last month after council resolved to expropriate land without compensation. On Wednesday, Masina described the motion against him as "frivolous". He also said the coalition was working well in the only remaining metro in Gauteng governed by the ANC. The ANC took control of the city through a coalition with the PAC, African Independent Congress (AIC), the Patriotic Alliance and the Rate Payers' Association. Earlier, the AIC suspended three of its councillors, accusing them of forming a parallel structure. On Thursday the party threw its weight behind the ANC, in spite of a previous threat not to do so.
