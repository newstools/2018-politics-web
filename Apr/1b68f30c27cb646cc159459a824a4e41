CV ‘dumping’ scandal put to rest as City of Tshwane concludes investigation 17 April 2018 An internal investigation regarding the transportation on the back of an open bakkie, of application forms for the 581 vacant positions at the City of Tshwane, has been concluded and no wrongdoing has been found, the City said. "The City has also satisfied itself that all the CVs which were loaded onto the van, were successfully delivered to the One-Stop Centre for sorting," it said. According to the City, the pictures that first sparked outcry were taken by an applicant who was queuing to submit an application form as a City employee loaded the forms onto the van. City manager Moeketsi Mosola initiated the investigation on April 4 after images circulated on social media showing forms packed and loaded onto a van. South Africans took to Twitter to lambast the City for "dumping" the applications. "The application forms in the circulating pictures were being packed at the City's offices in Temba, Region 2, to be transported to the City's recruitment offices – One-Stop Centre at Bothongo Plaza West in the CBD," said City spokesperson Selby Bokaba. Bokaba said that the City had previously introduced the e-recruitment system to avoid applicants queuing at their offices. The City is currently working out a few technical glitches to ensure that the system operates at an optimal level. "The City manager has prioritised the filling of administrative posts to enable personnel to respond quickly and speedily to service delivery interruptions and to complaints from irate customers," said Bokaba.
