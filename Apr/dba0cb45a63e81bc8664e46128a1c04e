DA calls on IPID to investigate SAPS conduct during North West protests 30 April 2018 The Democratic Alliance in the North West has written to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) requesting an investigation into SAPS conduct during protests, which swept across the Province. On Saturday 21 April 2018, the DA visited families who were affected by the police action during the protests. We were informed that police barged into people’s houses shooting at children and old people. We were also informed that police acted with force against community members who were just innocent bystanders. They also shot at people who were laying on the ground. We furthermore met with a family who told us that police unfairly discriminated against them, using derogative terms such as “bushmen” and telling them that they did not belong there. During our visit we were informed that police promised to pay for the hospital expenses for those injured but we could not find proof that this was done. Due to the serious nature of injuries sustained by Cuan Everrett we decided to take him to hospital to get medical attention. See photo here. The behavior displayed by members of the police is completely unacceptable, police officers should serve and protect not discriminate or shoot at innocent people. Our province has an unfortunate history of police brutality, and we cannot afford to have another Marikana massacre on our hands. In the short-term, Supra Mahumapelo must be removed, and come 2019 the people must exercise their power by voting for total change.
