ANC cripples Brandfort The DA is appalled at the lack of action from the ANC in addressing the water situation in Brandfort. This community is now on day 21 without water. Last night, residents took to the streets, protesting a lack of water for the past three weeks due to failing infrastructure. The protests are still continuing today. This is the result of years of poor management of both Masilonyana’s finances and infrastructure under the ANC. The lack of water does not only negatively affect the businesses in Brandfort, but also schools and the most vulnerable of our residents. Earlier today the Speaker and Mayor of Masilonyana Municipality decided to cancel a special council meeting due to safety concerns, to which the DA objected. It is no use running away from your responsibilities towards the people who elected us. This past Monday ANC Chairperson Gwede Mantashe in the presence of the Free State Premier, Sisi Ntombela, made the hollow promise that the water situation in this town would be attended to urgently. He used the memorial service of the late Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela for this cheap political point scoring. Nothing has come from these promises. Ntombela herself was previously the MEC for CoGTA who oversaw the decline of our municipalities. It is unacceptable that 24 years after the ANC took power, South Africans still have to struggle to get a basic service such as water. A DA government will ensure that we prioritise the effective management of Masilonyana’s finances and basic infrastructure in order to deliver quality services for all.
