MyCiTi buses still grounded 22 April 2018 The nationwide strike action affecting the South African bus industry is continuing. It is unclear when the strike action, which is the result of dead-locked wage negotiations, will come to an end. Those making use of road-based transport should expect heavy traffic and longer travelling times for as long as the strike continues, in particular at the start of a new work week. The lock-out instituted by the Vehicle Operating Companies operating the MyCiTi service will thus remain in place until further notice. Regretfully, this means that there will be no MyCiTi trunk or feeder services available for as long as the strike and lock-out continue. MyCiTi commuters are requested to make alternative travelling arrangements for the time being. The City is monitoring the situation, and will provide commuters with updates as far as possible. Those commuters with monthly MyCiTi tickets must note that the monthly packages will be extended for a period equal to the number of days that the strike action lasts. The extension will be determined once the strike has come to an end. Further details will be communicated in due course. Commuters are also advised to visit the MyCiTi website on www.myciti.org.za for regular updates; and to follow us on Twitter @MyCiTiBus; or to phone the Transport Information Centre on 0800 65 64 63 – the TIC is available 24/7.
