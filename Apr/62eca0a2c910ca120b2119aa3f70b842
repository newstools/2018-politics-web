Safety and security of Attridgeville schools under threat 3 April 2018 The DA is very concerned about the security of schools’ assets following numerous burglaries in schools in and around Attridgeville in Tshwane. Several schools in the area have been robbed in recent weeks. Last week alone, Dr WF Nkomo High School had two break-ins in which seven laptops, nine computers, two smartboards and pantry supplies were stolen. There was also a break-in at Masizane Primary School, Thohoyandou Primary School and Flavius Mareka Secondary School where computers and pantry supplies were taken. Phuthaditshaba Primary School was also broken into in February and most of their administration-related equipment has been stolen. The same applies to Phelindaba Secondary School where there have been 3 break-ins this year where 4 smartboards, as well as laptops, calculators and computers were stolen. The DA will table a motion at the Legislature for the department to prioritize safety and security in our schools. The motion will emphasize the need to install alarm and camera systems in our schools, to link all schools with police stations, get police specialists to focus on school safety and drive a campaign to get buy-in from the community to take ownership of our schools. These measures will minimize the losses of our schools’ assets and will save the department money when replacing the stolen items. School patrollers aren’t properly trained or lack skills to fight crime in our schools. The department is incurring losses since the introduction of innovative learning and teaching facilities. We will recommend that the department explores the feasibility of employing permanent security guards to safeguard schools, particularly in areas that have a high crime rate.
