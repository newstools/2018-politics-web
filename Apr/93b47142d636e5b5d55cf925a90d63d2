Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba costs tax payers nearly R900,000 in legal fees for Fireblade case 19 April 2018 In response to a parliamentary question from the Democratic Alliance Chief Whip, John Steenhuisen, the Department of Home Affairs has confirmed that R874 199,25 of tax payers’ money has been spent so far on Minister Malusi Gigaba’s legal fees in the Fireblade Aviation (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Home Affairs matter. It is absolutely unacceptable that Minister Gigaba’s ongoing involvement in the Fireblade Aviation matter will only continue to incur legal fees as he attempts to overturn the damning findings of the High Court which concluded that he lied under oath and violated the Constitution. Thus far, Minister Gigaba has lost his appeal to a full bench of the High Court, a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal and it’s highly likely that his current bid to have the Constitutional Court hear the matter will also fail. The amount of legal costs incurred by the Department of Home Affairs to protect a constitutional delinquent will only continue to escalate has he needlessly pursues this matter at the expense of tax payers. It is simply not enough for President Cyril Ramaphosa to express “great concern” or “give serious attention” to Minister Gigaba’s unlawful conduct - the damning findings and escalating legal costs demands that President Ramaphosa immediately intervene and take action against the Minister. The DA has already laid a formal complaint with the Public Protector requesting that she investigate Minister Gigaba’s conduct in the matter in light of the serious findings of the High Court. We will continue our engagements with the Public Protector to ensure that her investigation into Minister Gigaba is now expedited so that he can be held to account.
