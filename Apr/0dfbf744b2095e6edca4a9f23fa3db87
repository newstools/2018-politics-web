MEC must commit to keeping rural areas safe 23 April 2018 The Democratic Alliance again calls on the MEC of Community Safety and Transport Management, Dr Mpho Motlhabane, to show that he cares about our local, rural communities and brings back Rural Safety Units. The call comes after a 60 year old elderly woman was strangled and threatened on her farm near Vryburg over the weekend. The DA is extremely distressed by this latest incident. Not only is the victim a woman, elderly and unable to defend herself, but the level of violence in the attack is unacceptable. The four attackers strangled her and threatened to kill her with a screwdriver. There seems to be no end to these attacks that affect the lives of farmers and farm workers in our farming communities throughout the province. Farmers are key to food security in South Africa and we should do everything in our power to protect those who are vulnerable, sitting ducks to criminals. The DA is committed to finding solutions which we believe must include the reintroduction of rural safety units. It is time for Total Change under a new, caring government. It can no longer be that those living in outlying areas in our province are simply left to fend for themselves at the mercy of violent criminals.
