EFF stands in solidarity with SAFTU regarding the strike to be held on 25 April 24 April 2018 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) stand in solidarity with the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) and we urge all workers to join the nationwide strike to be held on the 25th of April requesting the National Minimum Wage (NMW) Bill to be amended. The government has already imposed VAT, Sugar Tax, Fuel Levy and all other manners of taxes to resolve an economic crisis that the workers did not create, the very same government proposes that the NMW for all workers should be R20 per hour, even less than the minimum living wage that was the findings of the research from UCT in 2014. The ANC claims to advocate for Radical Economic Transformation and yet their proposed bill will further entrench poverty and cause the present inequalities to remain a permanent feature of our nation. This is clearly an attack on the labour force of South Africa and a deliberate programme to further oppress our people. The EFF calls on all workers to support this mass strike action and we demand better standards of living for all workers in South Africa as was promised by the current ruling party.
