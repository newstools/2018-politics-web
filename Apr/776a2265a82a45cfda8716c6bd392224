DA demands update on long overdue mental hospital 3 April 2018 The DA has today written to the MEC of Roads and Public Works, Mxolisi Sokatsha, for an urgent update on the new mental hospital, which was scheduled for completion over the Easter weekend. In a reply to a parliamentary question just over two weeks ago, Sokatsha stated that the new practical completion date for the hospital was 31 March 2018.  He further indicated that all works are 100% done at the hospital and that the project is on a snagging and de-snagging phase to rectify any faults. In this regard he said 70% of the building had been de-snagged. Construction of the R2 billion mental hospital has been dragging on for about 12 years already and it remains at the centre of controversy for having time and again missed its completion dates and for non-stop escalating building costs. Sokatsha owes it to the public to provide an update on the progress. He also needs to give feedback on the outstanding rates and taxes owed to Sol Plaatje Municipality by the Northern Cape Department of Roads and Public Works, specifically for the new mental hospital, as this can potentially jeopardize the handover of the completed Kimberly mental hospital to the Health Department. At last known date, Sokatsha indicated that while they were having meetings to finalize this matter, it had not been resolved as yet. The people of the Northern Cape have waited long enough for a dedicated mental health facility in the province. At the very least, they deserve openness and transparency with regards to the future of mental health care in the province.
