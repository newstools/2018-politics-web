SADTU Gauteng condemns an act of barbarism by some white people 26 April 2018 SADTU condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the barbaric act of some White minority lunatics who hung an effigy of Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi at the Department of Basic Education premises depicing the MEC as if he was raping Afrikaans. These hooligans show utmost disrespect for the Constitution of our country which advocates for the creation of a non racial society which embodies the aspirations of all the people of South Africa.The promotion of multilingualism is central to building this society. We are fully behind the radical education transformation unfolding in our province under the leadership of MEC Lesufi.This can only justify the urgency of transforming all remaining Afrikaans medium schools to give access to the  the majority of our people to these institutions. We call on the MEC and Gauteng Department of Education to remain resolute in implementing the radical education transformation  agenda. Issued by Tseliso Ledimo, Provincial Secretary, SADTU, 26 April 2018
