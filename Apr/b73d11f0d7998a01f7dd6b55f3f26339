MEDIA STATEMENT BY PATRICIA DE LILLE 8 APRIL 2018 It is no secret that there are individuals in the DA who have been trying to get rid of me at any cost for the last few months. They have repeatedly shown that they would flout their own processes and ignore their own values of 'Freedom, Fairness and Opportunity' in order to have me removed. Changing their own Federal Constitution through the newly passed "De Lille Clause" shows just how far they are willing to go to avoid their own due process. I have been fighting for a fair and transparent process amidst the slew of allegations that have been thrown my way. The DA should be aware that, even if they refuse to follow due process in the spirit of fairness, the laws of our country protect public representatives. As someone who fought for those rights during the struggle against apartheid, I will not tire in ensuring that the hearing I have asked for is open to both the media and the public. They deserve to hear my defence in the interest of clearing my name in the most transparent way possible. Statement issued by Patricia de Lille, 17 April 2018
