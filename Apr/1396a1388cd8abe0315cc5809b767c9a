The fascist tendencies of the BDS and the ANC have been exposed over DJ Black Coffee's performance in Israel 4 April 2018 This time, renowned international DJ Black Coffee has borne the brunt of these radical views. South Africa's internationally famed DJ Black Coffee has again come under vicious attack for playing music in Israel. Following his recent performance in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Friday 30 March, the ANC and BDS SA organisation have come out with a statement expressing their 'outrage' at the artist, accusing him of violating a non-existent “cultural boycott on Israel”, which they have so desperately and unsuccessfully tried to implement. DJ Black Coffee has seen Israel for himself on multiple occasions and is just one of the increasing numbers of artists to visit and fall in love with the country. The BDS campaign is failing around the world with artists such as Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Paul McCartney, Ziggy Marley, Die Antwoord, Loyiso Bala, Rolling Stones, Alicia Keys, Jason Derulo, Jon Bon Jovi, Craig David, Steve Aoki, Nick Cave, Backstreet Boys, Justin Timberlake, OneRepublic, amongst many others, having all performed there in just the last while. Having failed to convince anyone to follow them, the ANC and BDS have all too typically tried instead to undermine their freedom of association through intimidation and abuse.  They have sought to exploit these musicians for their own narrow agendas instead of encouraging them to use their music as a universal language and a tool for peace and unity. The South African Friends of Israel condemn such statements, which does absolutely nothing for the Palestinian people, but rather defames and violates the rights of South Africans.
