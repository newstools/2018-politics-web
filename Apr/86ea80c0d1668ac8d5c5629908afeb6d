AfriForum files corruption charges against Shaun Abrahams 11 April 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum today filed criminal charges of corruption, fraud, theft, extortion and forgery against Shaun Abrahams, the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), and six other senior members of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). “This follows after AfriForum received an anonymous letter that elaborates on allegations of serious criminal conduct. In this letter is a plea for AfriForum to ensure that the rot within the NPA is not allowed to continue,” says Monique Taute, Head of AfriForum’s Anti-Corruption Unit. “One allegation refers to a covertly-funded fraudulent travel claim from four members of the NPA. The claims, submitted for authorisation to travel to Zeerust, misrepresent the fact that they actually travelled to Cape Town and spent R97 000 of these covert funds,” says Taute. In a further allegation it is suspected that a witness protection vehicle was allocated to the NDPP, who then used the vehicle for personal benefit. “I believe the suggestion here is that all government assets are strictly governed and that the logbooks, etc. must at all times – even under covert circumstances – reflect the factual use of the asset, but in this case the NDPP has corruptly ensured a personal and/or gratuitous official benefit to which he is not entitled,” adds Taute. She further says that she believes that the allegations are of an alarming nature and therefore requests the South African Police Service (SAPS) to investigate the allegations made in the anonymous letter received by AfriForum. Taute concludes that these allegations should now be enough reason for President Cyril Ramaphosa to remove Abrahams from office, as it is clear that he is not a fit and proper person to hold office.
