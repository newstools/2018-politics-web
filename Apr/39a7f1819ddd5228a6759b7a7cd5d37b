Challenge is on to save water come rain or shine 4 April 2018 During the past week, the dams supplying Cape Town declined by 0,3% to 21,9%. This decline, which is lower than in previous weeks, is a welcome confirmation of the impact of the continued efforts by Capetonians to save water, and includes a small contribution from rainfall. Dam levels are however still lower than they were in previous years at this time, and we have to continue our saving efforts to ensure that we get through this year safely.  Our collective consumption over the past week was 521 million litres of water per day, which indicates a stabilisation of consumption at lower levels than were being achieved in January and February.Â While this remains a considerable achievement, as a City we need to continue to work harder to reduce consumption even further. Getting down to 50 litres per day is the only way to keep Day Zero away. Issued by Alderman Ian Neilson, Executive Deputy Mayor, City of Cape Town, 4 April 2018
