The primary objective of the investigation that will be conducted by Advocate T Motau SC is to establish whether: 1. any of the business of VBS was conducted with the intent to defraud depositors or other creditors of the bank, or for any other fraudulent purpose; 2. VBS’s business conduct involved questionable and/or reckless business practices or material non-disclosure, with or without the intent to defraud depositors and other creditors; and 3. there had been any irregular conduct by VBS’s shareholders, directors, executive management, staff, stakeholders and/or related parties. Based on the findings of the forensic investigation, the CEO of the PA will take appropriate follow-up action. 1 The PA is a juristic person operating within the administration of the South African Reserve Bank.
