Inquiry into Gupta naturalisation postponed due to ANC MPs’ lack of attendance 16 April 2018 The Home Affairs Portfolio Committee meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been cancelled due to a lack of quorum. Without ANC members present, the meeting could not go on as planned and this has effectively delayed the inquiry into the Gupta family’s naturalisation. The meeting was intended to set the Terms of Reference for the Gupta naturalisation matter. This may be a move to postpone the long overdue inquiry and for the Guptas to avoid accountability. The DA will write to the Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Lemias Mashile, to request that a new date is set urgently and that all MPs make sure they are available so that the terms for the Inquiry can be set. It is the responsibility of MPs to perform their oversight role and to hold those responsible for aiding and abetting the Guptas to account. That the ANC members of the committee have failed to avail themselves to attend this vital meeting is an indictment of their commitment to getting to the bottom of the matter.
