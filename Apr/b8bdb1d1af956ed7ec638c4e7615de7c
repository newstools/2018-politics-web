The NUM strongly condemns the  brutal killing of six workers at Burgersfort in Limpopo The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is deeply shocked and saddened after six workers died and several were seriously injured when a petrol bomb was thrown at a bus transporting them to work at Modikwa Platinum Mine outside Burgersfort in Limpopo last night at 10 pm. "We can confirm that the bus was carrying 39 workers who were going to work at Modikwa Platinum Mine when it was petrol bombed by unknown people at Driekop.  Six workers were burned beyond recognition and the other workers had to escape through windows. We also do not know what is the motive of the attack on those innocent workers who were going to work," said Phillip Mankge, NUM North East Regional Secretary. The NUM calls on the law enforcement agencies in Limpopo to hunt down the perpetrators of this evil and atrocious act and arrests them. There have been a number of incidences in Burgersfort and surrounding areas recently that led to road closures and trucks burned down. The NUM is worried that the police are not arresting the perpetrators of these violent acts. May their precious souls rest in peace.
