RIP Elza: DA has lost a great woman and leader 19 April 2018 The DA sends our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the Kouga Municipality Executive Mayor, Elza van Lingen, who passed away today. Our thoughts and prayers are with Elza’s family at this difficult time. Elza was a kind and generous person who has left a lasting impact on all those she met, worked with and served. She was a great friend and formidable leader who refused to let her battle with cancer stop her from soldiering on and working hard for the people of Kouga. The DA is deeply saddened by this great loss. The lives of the citizens of Kouga have been greatly improved through Elza’s passion and tireless efforts. Elza’s drive and determination saw her elected as DA Councillor in 2002 in what is now known as Sarah Baartman District Municipality where she served for 6 years before being elected by the DA to serving on the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) during the 2009 Elections. In November 2011 she was elected as the Leader of the DA in the NCOP and re-elected in 2014. The DA will always remember Elza for visionary leadership and for dedicating her adult life to serve every community she ever lived in. She served the people in an inimitable fashion in her political career. She was an inspiration to all of us in the DA and her passing will leave an enormous void in our organisation. We also wish to thank her husband Mike and their family for the incredible support and sacrifices they made in order that Elza could fulfil her driving passion of service to her community and constituencies.
