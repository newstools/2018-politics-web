42 Esidimeni inquests finalised 9 April 2018 The police have opened 46 inquest cases into the deaths of Life Esidimeni patients, 42 of which have been finalized. This is disclosed by Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. The delay in finalizing four of the cases is due to “outstanding post-mortem reports and missing hospital records.” A total of 144 cases of death are being investigated and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) “is currently in the process of formulating charges.” I am disappointed that some post-mortem reports are still not completed and that missing hospital records are delaying the police investigation. How can it be that autopsies are not complete more than 18 months after the deaths? I am also concerned that there are no inquests for 98 of the 144 recorded deaths. It is vital that all available evidence is speedily collected so that charges are laid against all those implicated in the deaths, as well as other charges including contraventions of the Mental Health Act and complicity in issuing fraudulent licenses to NGOs.
