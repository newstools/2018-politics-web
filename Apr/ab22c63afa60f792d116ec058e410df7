DA-led City of Tshwane a place of hope and prosperity 12 April 2018 Today, DA Mayor of Tshwane, Solly Msimanga laid bare the fruits of what a clean and efficient government can achieve. Today we heard of the tangible outcomes of the DA difference. I would like to thank Mayor Msimanga and his team, as well as our coalition partners and those in the opposition that have held us to account, for effecting real change to the residents of Tshwane. In places previously ignored by the former administration, change is taking place. Tarred roads are being laid, title deeds are being handed over to rightful beneficiaries and economic opportunities are blossoming. Through the work of this administration, the private sector is willing to roll up its sleeves and partner with the City to benefit all who reside within its borders. Innovation and people centred governance is restoring the dignity of our people. We are also making strides to reduce our footprint on the environment. Using natural gas and other green initiatives we are on the cutting edge of administering a truly eco-friendly city. It is with great pride that another municipality can fly the DA flag with pride. This is what people expect and deserve of government. An administration which puts the people first and restores their dignity. This is what the people of Gauteng can look forward to in 2019 under a DA government. Together we can bring about total change to the people of this great province.
