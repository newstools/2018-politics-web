ANC welcomes terms of reference for inquiry into Gupta family naturalisation 24 April 2018 The ANC Study Group on Home Affairs welcomes today’s adoption of the terms of reference by the portfolio committee for an inquiry into the process of granting the Gupta family naturalisation. The inquiry will be conducted in terms of in terms of Rule 227 (1)(c) of the National Assembly, which states that Committees of Parliament may monitor, investigate, inquire into and make recommendations concerning any such executive organ of state, (falling within its mandate). The committee’s decision of an inquiry follows an instruction from House Chairperson, comrade Cedric Frolick, for portfolio committees to probe accusations of state capture linked to alleged emails involving a number of state institutions in June 2017. The adopted terms of reference will have two phases; the first phase will require the committee to compile a timeline for verification of documents from all stakeholders involved in granting of the Gupta family naturalisation. The second phase will consider the outcomes of the fact finding process and determine further steps to be taken. The inquiry will further look into foreign employees working for the Gupta family and other naturalisations which have taken place in the past ten years. As the ANC, we will ensure that this inquiry is conducted thoroughly and speedily to ensure that this matter is fairly and transparently brought to finalisation. The people of South Africa have entrusted the ANC to safeguard the laws of this country and we shall not fall short on our mandate. Issued by Nonceba Mhlauli, Spokesperson, ANC, 24 April 2018
