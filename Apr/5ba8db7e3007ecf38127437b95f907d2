City of Joburg to honour Winnie Madikizela-Mandela 26 April 2018  Today, the Johannesburg City Council took the decision to mandate the City’s Section 79 Committee on Community Development to begin a process to determine an appropriate manner through which to honour the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The original report was amended before tabling in Council, to ensure that a process will be followed that will be consultative, involving Councillors across the spectrum of political parties to participate in this process. This was done to ensure the process transcends party politics, in accordance for the manner in which her legacy has. The consultative process to be undertaken by the Committee will serve to identify a befitting tribute to the Mother of the Nation, and will also allow the community at large, as well as Mama Winnie’s family, to make and consider proposals to pay homage to the struggle icon. In taking the decision to formally honour Mama Winnie – a proud resident of the City – Council noted that she spent her life as a pro-poor warrior fighting against the injustices of Apartheid South Africa. The unanimous nature of support in Council for this decision is a tribute to her legacy transcending any political party. Mama Winnie will forever be remembered as one of the most renowned struggle veterans of the Apartheid-era, and as a women who harboured a deep commitment to the service of the people of this country. Mama Winnie worked tirelessly to build a nation underpinned by freedom and equality for all and should be honoured in a manner befitting her enduring legacy. Her life was well lived, and her dedication selfless and fierce. Statement issued by Cllr Herman Mashaba, Executive Mayor, City of Johannesburg, 26 April 2018
