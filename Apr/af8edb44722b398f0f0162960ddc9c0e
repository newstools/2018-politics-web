COSATU is not part of the planned strike on Wednesday 24 April 2018 COSATU has noted with deep concern the misleading statements by some leaders of SAFTU, who have been claiming that COSATU will join their planned strike on Wednesday 25th of April 2018. We want to make it clear that this is totally not true and COSATU is not part of the planed strike. We condemn the mischievous attempt to confuse our members by SAFTU. COSATU supports the National Minimum Wage and we have no reason to strike over something that will benefit the workers. The minimum wage will be a huge achievement that will see wages rise for the 47% of workers (6 million) ,who earn less than R20 an hour currently.  This represents the foundation that will help us built towards the goal of a living wage. The strike on Wednesday is based on fabrication, misrepresentation and outlandish conspiracy theories.
