SAPU supports lifestyle audits in SAPS 18 April 2018 The South African Policing Union fully supports the introduction of lifestyle audits in the South African Police Service top management. South Africa is crippled with fraud and corruption and as the police being part of the South African society, it cannot escape such challenges. We welcome the initiative to introduce lifestyle audits in the police top management, which has been long overdue. By welcoming this progressive initiative, we are not by any means implying that our top management is corrupt. We believe in the notion that prevention is better than cure. The police are a vital state organ that deals with corruption and general law enforcement in the country. As the South African Police Service, who abhor corruption and crime it is therefore obvious that offenders, would want to capture the police in an attempt to escape being arrested. We have witnessed many instances were double standards were applied in the police and where functionary members were made sacrificial lambs. SAPU believes that SAPS management as a clean institution will not have a problem with these lifestyle audits being conducted, and welcomes this step in what we believe is one in the right direction.
