DIRCO must disclose reasons for Mr Van Pletzen’s arrest in Dubai 12 April 2018 The DA will write to the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), Lindiwe Sisulu, to find out exactly what charges have been laid against South African businessman, Justin Mr Van Pletzen, after he was arrested in Dubai allegedly for filming Ajay Gupta without his permission. The DA will also request that the Minister set out the steps available to the South African government and which the government is prepared to take if there is no basis for the charges against Mr Van Pletzen, or that any of his procedural and substantive rights were violated in the process of detaining him. Minister Sisulu must ensure that the government of Dubai is holding Mr Van Pletzen in conditions that are consistent with his human rights. It is well known that the Gupta family has vested interests in Dubai and that they will do anything to escape accounting for their role in the state capture. The DA applauds Mr Pletzen for his patriotism and bravery for filming Ajay Gupta in Dubai when South African Authorities have been trying to track him down to serve a summons on him to appear before the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, currently investigating the capture of our country’s state-owned enterprises. No South African should be intimidated by the Guptas who have consistently evaded accountability despite various invitations to appear before Parliament. The DA urges the South African government to act to protect Mr Van Pletzen and ensure that his rights are not being compromised in an attempt to protect the compromised Guptas.
