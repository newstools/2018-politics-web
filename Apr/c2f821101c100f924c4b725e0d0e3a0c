SACP condemns in the strongest terms possible the apartheid regime of Israel, its racist attitude and atrocities 11 April 2018 The time for action against Israeli Apartheid is now! The apartheid regime of Israel is violating international law, and with absolute impunity. The regime appears to believe that no matter what its leaders and repressive machinery do, they will face no consequences for their atrocities. The apartheid regime of Israel is protected by imperial powers, and United States in the main. However, there is another power, the power of progressive governments and peace loving people across the world, that can hold Israel accountable. Since last week Friday, 6 April 2018 Israeli snipers have shot and killed over 30 unarmed Palestinians and injured more than 1 500, including journalists and teenagers. The apartheid state of Israel has recently adopted draconian measures to kick out African migrants and enticing them with money to leave and threatening them with jail if they are still in Israel after March 2018. This is a breaking point and South Africa must respond decisively, in accordance with international law. The SACP is not calling merely for democratic state action. The Party will be joining other civil society formations in the mass protests and other actions in solidarity with the Palestinians #GreatReturnMarch. South Africa’s position should be clear: on the streets, in our political resolutions and in government! The time for statements is over, and the time for action is well over due! The SACP welcomed the resolution by our alliance partner and governing party, the ANC, to “immediately and unconditionally downgrade the South African embassy in Israel to a liaison office”. Sufficient time has now passed and its implementation must happen with immediate effect. There must be no further delay. Issued by Alex Mohubetswane Mashilo, National Spokesperson, SACP, 11 April 2018
