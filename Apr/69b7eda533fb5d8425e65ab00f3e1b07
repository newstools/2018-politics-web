Comment on Judicial Tribunal recommendation to impeach Judge Motata 18 April 2018 While Freedom Under Law (FUL) welcomes the recommendation of the Judicial Tribunal that Judge Nkola Motata be impeached, it records serious concern that it should have taken 11 years from the events in question to reach this point. Throughout this period the judge received, and receives, his full emoluments. FUL observes that other pending matters before the JSC, in particular that involving Judge President Hlophe, have also taken, and continue to take, many years, without final resolution and at significant cost to the taxpayer. Final resolution of these matters is in the public interest and safeguards the integrity of the judiciary and FUL requests that the JSC act to now ensure expeditious resolution.
