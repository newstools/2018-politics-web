Government on conclusion of public sector wage negotiations 5 Apr 2018 The Minister for the Public Service and Administration, Ms. Ayanda Dlodlo has noted with concern, media reports that government is unnecessarily delaying the public sector wage negotiations process. In this regard, the Minister would like to assure all public servants and the public in general that government has no intention to delay the public sector negotiations process. “On behalf of government and the Committee of Ministers, which includes: Ministers of Finance, Defence, Health, Basic Education, Justice and Correctional Services, Police and Social Development, I would like to restate our commitment to this process and assure all stakeholders that we will not rest until a best possible outcome is found between the negotiating parties” she said The negotiating parties are currently locked in a facilitation process, under the guidance of the Public Service Coordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC). The Minister indicated that the current round of negotiations, which addresses both the cost of living allowance as well as the improvement of other conditions of service for public servants is being undertaken under very difficult economic conditions. She said this places an additional responsibility on both parties, the State as an Employer and the Public Sector Unions, to ensure that the outcome of the negotiations contributes to improving the conditions of service of public servants as well as ensuring the sustainability of government’s personnel expenditure. The Minister appealed for patience from all the public servants and the public at large, to afford the negotiating parties at the PSCBC sufficient time to reach an amicable negotiated settlement.
