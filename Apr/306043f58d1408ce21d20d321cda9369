SANDF soldier nabbed in for business robbery 24 April 2018 Limpopo police say they have arrested a South African National Defence Force soldier and one other suspect following a business robbery in Nzhelele on Monday. According to a police statement on Tuesday, members of the Limpopo tracking team received information about a group of suspects who were planning to commit a cash-in-transit heist in the Vhembe area. After following up on the information, police tracked down the suspects who had just robbed a business in Nzhelele, before speeding off towards Thohoyandou. After a car chase, the police eventually stopped the vehicle and arrested the two. The vehicle that the suspects were travelling in had military registration plates, the statement said. "Preliminary investigations found that the BMW belongs to the SANDF VIP section and that the driver is an employee of the SANDF," police said. Police also recovered a 9mm pistol with the serial number filed off, blue dash lights, registration plates, and over R2 000 in cash. Further information received led the police to other vehicles, allegedly used by the suspects, which were hidden in a house in Matanda village. "Members of a tracking team followed up and, at that homestead, three cars with altered chassis numbers were found," the statement said. News24
