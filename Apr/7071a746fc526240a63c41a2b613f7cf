DA cautiously welcomes SIU corruption probe The DA welcomes President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to order the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) to investigate corruption at Transnet and Eskom. This investigation is long overdue given the damning evidence that has surfaced regarding corruption and financial mismanagement at these two entities, linked to politically connected individuals. The DA is firmly committed to rooting out corruption within our state-owned entities (SOEs). The Public Enterprise Committee’s Inquiry into Eskom, which the DA has been actively involved in, has done sterling work in uncovering large-scale corruption at Eskom. We have also laid numerous criminal charges against former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe, former Eskom CFO Anoj Singh, Gupta-linked firm Trillian, McKinsey, SAP and the Bank of Baroda based on allegations of their involvement in looting the state through SOEs. We offer our full cooperation to this investigation and trust it will be thorough and concluded as soon as possible. For far too long, individuals and entities have been allowed to loot the state without consequence. Investigating the rot within SOEs is the first step Ramaphosa must take in proving that he is serious about fighting corruption. However, Ramaphosa’s decision cannot be lauded until the necessary steps are taken to bring the perpetrators of State Capture to book. The DA will keep an eye on further developments regarding the probe into State Capture and will not rest until those who are found guilty are held accountable.
