Mafikeng – ANC and Supra just as guilty for causing damage as protestors 19 April 2018 Riots triggered by protests in Mafikeng, where residents are demanding the resignation of North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo, indicate the level of damage that the ANC has caused the province. It is with great concern that the FF Plus takes note of reports that two people have already died in the second day of clashes between police and protesters in Mafikeng, which has now been paralysed by the ANC’s inability to keep its infighting within the party. All the residents in Mafikeng are now being terrorised due to the dissatisfaction with Mahumapelo – roads to and from town have been closed and some businesses even closed their doors for the day. Steps have been taken, in cooperation with the police, to ensure the safety of students on the NWU Mafikeng campus where classes have also been cancelled due to the violent protests. The FF Plus is particularly worried that the violence may spread to the rest of the province due to the fact that Mahumapelo is too stubborn to step down as premier and the ANC lacks political leadership to get rid of him. South Africa runs the risk of becoming a police state with the police having to restrain unhappy residents while corrupt high-level politicians are being protected. Mafikeng cannot afford to have the ANC’s inability to hold its leadership accountable cause its people to live in fear and its economy to be paralysed.
