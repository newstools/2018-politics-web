DA congratulates SAPS and Metro Police for rescuing infant thrown from roof 16 April 2018 The DA joins the rest of South Africa in congratulating the South Africa Police Service (SAPS) and the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Police for the commendable work they did in preventing grievous harm to an infant who was thrown off a roof by her father in Kwadwesi township in Port Elizabeth, during a police operation. Today, I attended the trial of the father together with the DA Eastern Cape Leader, Nqaba Bhanga. We particularly would like to take this opportunity to applaud Constable Luyolo Nojulumba for his heroic efforts and standing his ground to ensure the safety of the infant. That this father was willing to endanger his own child for the sake of a political protest, amounts to gross domestic abuse and cannot go unpunished. Law enforcement agencies work under the most difficult conditions and it is essential that we give them the recognition they deserve when they make us all proud. SAPS and the Metro Police are at the coalface of the fight against crime and is therefore essential that police members who work in the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) units, work diligently to bring justice to the victims and survivors of sexual abuse and domestic violence. The DA hopes that Constable Nojulumba’s heroism will be one of many acts that will come to define the women and men in blue, as we strive for crime-free and safe communities.
