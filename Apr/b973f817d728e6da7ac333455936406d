DA welcomes the resignation of Johan Van Zyl as a board member of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. 18 April 2018 We welcome the resignation of Johan van Zyl as a member of the Supervisory Board of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. What is striking is the complete failure to take responsibility, and the total lack of any remorse, despite the fact that: - he was a sitting member of the Supervisory Board when the scandal surrounding “accounting irregularities” emerged at Steinhoff International Holdings N.V.; and - he wanted a once off payment of €100 000 for “additional work undertaken” as a result of the scandal surrounding “accounting irregularities” at Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. The truth is that Johan van Zyl is an arsonist turned fire fighter who has tried to position himself as a crusader, committed to uncovering the truth, and fixing what went wrong, when, in fact, the scandal surrounding “accounting irregularities” took place on his watch at Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. Issued by David Maynier, DA Shadow Minister of Finance, 18 April 2018
