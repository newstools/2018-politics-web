Prosecution of Duduzane Zuma proves AfriForum’s prosecution strategy works AfriForum welcomes the National Prosecution Authority’s (NPA) decision to prosecute Duduzane Zuma, son of former president Jacob Zuma, on a criminal charge of culpable homicide. The civil rights organisation says that the decision is clear proof that the strategy of Adv Gerrie Nel, Head of AfriForum’s Private Prosecuting Unit, to ensure that no one is above the law, is bearing fruit. The NPA initially decided not to prosecute Zuma Jr. in connection with a vehicle accident on 1 February 2014 on the M1 highway in Gauteng – in which a young, female passenger, Mekelina Dube, died on impact. According to Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, this decision was overturned due to AfriForum’s willingness to institute private prosecution. “It firstly remains the duty of the NPA to prosecute offenders and when the possibility of private prosecution forces the NPA to do its work, AfriForum views it as a victory,” Kriel adds. According to Kriel, the decision to prosecute Zuma Jr. is also a victory for the Dube family, who now finally after more than four years will be able to see justice prevail. Kriel praised the Dube family for their willingness to insist that prosecution takes place and he indicated that AfriForum will continue to support the family in this case. Kriel adds that the NPA’s decision to institute prosecution against former president Jacob Zuma and the Guptas, with the knowledge that private prosecution would happen if they did not, also sends a strong message that no one can evade prosecution merely based on their political connections or position. “AfriForum hopes that the NPA would also ultimately decide to prosecute Julius Malema and Adv Nomgcobo Jiba under this pressure. AfriForum is however ready to prosecute these persons privately should the NPA neglect to prosecute,” says Kriel. With regard to the assault case against Grace Mugabe, Kriel says that AfriForum’s case to have her diplomatic immunity set aside will be heard on 10 and 11 May in the North Gauteng High Court.
