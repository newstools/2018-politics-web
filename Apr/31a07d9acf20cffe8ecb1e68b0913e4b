ANC jeopardising freedom in South Africa A true democracy’s value lies in that it ensures freedom for all the citizens in a country. The ANC, particularly with its adoption of the principle of expropriation without compensation, is jeopardising and destroying one of the pillars of democracy through its actions and, therefore, the ANC is a threat to true democracy as it is depriving citizens of their right to freedom. The Afrikaner’s democratic rights are particularly under threat, for example, they are deprived of their right to mother-tongue education when one considers the Constitutional Court’s ruling on the use of Afrikaans and English at the University of the Free State and the relentless attacks on Afrikaans launched by Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi. These attacks are a direct threat to the freedom of a certain segment of South African citizens, specifically all Afrikaans-speaking citizens. Expropriation without compensation is also a threat to the freedom of every single citizen of this country who owns property and is in contravention of the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The ANC is hypocritical because they are making a big fuss about supposedly having liberated South Africa and supposedly having ensured freedom for all, but the truth is that as government the ANC is busy destroying true democracy and the freedom of citizens.
