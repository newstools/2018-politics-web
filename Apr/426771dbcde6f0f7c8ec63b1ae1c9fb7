DA commemorates 25th anniversary of Chris Hani’s assassination 10 April 2018 The DA joins fellow South Africans in remembering the 25th anniversary of the brutal assassination of anti-apartheid freedom fighter, Chris Hani. Hani was gunned down by Janusz Walus on 10 April 1993. This senseless killing was an attempt to derail our country’s democratic process and almost brought South Africa to the brink of civil war. In a country where racism and prejudice still rear its ugly head, we must remember the ultimate sacrifice Hani paid for South Africa. After Hani’s killing, Nelson Mandela made it very clear that his death was a watershed moment in our history, one which did not result in civil war but which helped us move towards reconciliation. In remembering Hani death, South Africans must ensure that his death was not in vain. Every South African has a responsibility to play a part in ensuring that social cohesion is realised and that the reconciliation process continues. Chris Hani was a leader who knew that the struggle for true and lasting liberation would not end when democracy was attained, but that the struggle for social justice must continue. Hani warned against governments abusing their power for personal gain and not for the advancement of our people and it is sad to see that positions of power remain infiltrated by corrupt and out of touch leaders who have failed to change the status quo. The DA remembers Chris Hani and will continue to work to realise his dreams for our country. Issued by Refiloe Nt'sekhe, DA National Spokesperson, 10 April 2018
