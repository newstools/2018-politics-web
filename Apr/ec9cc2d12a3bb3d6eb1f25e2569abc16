De Lille and the EFF 12 April 2018 The DA notes the reports that the party has taken a decision to charge Cape Town Mayor, Patricia De Lille, over her attendance of the EFF’s Memorial Service in honour of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. These reports are simply untrue. Ms De Lille’s attendance at the memorial yesterday is a matter between her and the EFF leadership and not the DA. A courtesy call to alert the DA about her attendance would have been welcomed. As the DA, we received an official invitation from the EFF leadership and the Party sent the DA’s Free State Provincial Leader, Patricia Kopane, to commemorate Mama Winnie’s life and to pass on our condolences. The DA regularly receives invitations from other political parties to address events or rallies and this is not in any way unusual. However, we do ask that the individual concerned informs the Party leadership. The DA has, along with the nation, been mourning the death of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and refuses to be drawn into mud-slinging in her name. it is simply inappropriate. The DA leader will be paying his last respects at the official funeral this coming weekend as he had done last week during his visit to the family home.
