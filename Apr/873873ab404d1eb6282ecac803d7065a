Suspended GFC CEO paid R1.8 million for sitting at home 4 April 2018 The DA is shocked to learn that the CEO of the Gauteng Film Commission (GFC), Andile Mbeki, is still drawing a salary despite being placed on suspension. This was revealed to me by the MEC for Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation, Faith Mazibuko, in response to my questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. According to the MEC, Mbeki was suspended for the following: - Insubordination and ill-treatment of staff members - Illegal recording of MEC conversation during the meeting and distribution of the very conversation on social media without seeking permission from the MEC Despite the fact that the CEO has been charged he has not appeared before a Disciplinary Committee. The MEC has informed the DA, that they will seek an amicable resolution to part ways. Since being placed on suspension on 23 February 2017, Mbeki has received a salary totaling R1,882,094.00 including benefits. Currently the department is paying two CEOs, thus diverting money away from other important functions of the department. This indicates poor political management and leadership on the part of the MEC, as she has failed to resolve this matter. The DA demands that this be resolved as a matter of urgency to avoid any further wasteful expenditure.
