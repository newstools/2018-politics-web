Farmer of the year still positive after attack 15 February 2018 The well-known wine and cheese maker, Charles Back of Fairview estate in Paarl, was brutally attacked in his home on Tuesday morning while sleeping. He was also named Farmer of the Year for 2017. According to information provided, Back was attacked in the early hours of the morning by three men after they had broken the security doors. They escaped with electronic items and are still at large. “Agri SA condemns the attack in the strongest terms and regards it as another attack which creates a negative impression of the country abroad.  We cannot afford this type of bad publicity as it could have a detrimental effect on the tourism industry in the Western Cape and discourage tourists from visiting this sought-after part of our country,” said Dan Kriek, president of Agri SA. According to Rossouw Cillié, chair of the Pro-Agri Group, Back is a true leader and example during these changing times in South Africa.  Back is already involved in creating opportunities for his people by giving them a chance to empower themselves. Cillié said, “that he had learned from the principles that Back applies with empowerment and tries to do the same for his people. Back’s positive attitude is inspirational and he does not allow negative things to discourage him”. “This proves once again that attackers will do everything they can to achieve their goal, even attacking someone who does so much for his workers and the community. Despite his traumatic experience, Back returned to his farm on Wednesday after being discharged from hospital. He serves as an example to all of us by showing us that we should not allow such incidents to get us down,” said Kriek. Kriek called on the police to do everything possible to arrest and charge the perpetrators. He wished Back a speedy recovery.
