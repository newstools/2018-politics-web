Makhura must resign as Premier of Gauteng because of Esidimeni lies 31 January 2018 The Gauteng Premier, Mr David Makhura, must do the honourable thing and resign as premier, because during the ongoing Life Esidimeni arbitration hearing, it came to light that he intentionally lied to the Gauteng Legislature about the matter, says Philip van Staden, FF Plus MPL in the Gauteng Legislature. Van Staden says that Makhura repeatedly told the members of the Legislature that he was not aware that the Esidimeni contracts were going to be terminated, but during his testimony in the ongoing arbitration hearing, he admitted that he was indeed aware of the termination of the contracts. “Clearly, the Premier deceived the Legislature by lying to all of us. The fact that he testified that he did not read the reports by the MEC’s indicates that he was not doing his job as Premier properly. “He also denied knowing about a media release issued by the Department on the 21st of October 2015, which stated that the contracts would be terminated. “Makhura must now accept responsibility for the deaths of the 144 patients. He must also be prosecuted for the role he played in the tragedy. “Furthermore, he admitted that he could have done more and that he can’t run away from it all now. If the Premier is committed to do his best to set things right, he must do the honourable thing and resign as the premier of Gauteng,” says Van Staden.
