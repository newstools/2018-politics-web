JUSTICE AND CORRECTIONAL SERVICES COMMITTEE APPLAUDS PRESIDENT’S WITHDRAWL OF APPEAL ON NDPP APPOINTMENT Parliament, Friday, 23 February 2018 – Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has welcomed the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to withdraw the appeal against the judgment of the North Gauteng High Court that the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Adv Shaun Abrahams should vacate his position. Committee Chairperson, Dr Mathole Motshekga said the Committee noted the decision. “The Committee is pleased to see that we have a President that has hit the ground running. He is clearly working hard from the onset to ensure a better South Africa,” said Dr Motshekga. Former President Jacob Zuma previously appealed the ruling of a full Bench of Judges of the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria that found he was conflicted to appoint the NDPP. The case is scheduled to be heard in the Constitutional Court on Wednesday as Adv Abrahams is still appealing the matter. Dr Motshekga said President Ramaphosa’s speedy response to matters since he came into office last week will assist to make the oversight work of the Committee easier. “It is clear that we do not have absentee landlord, but who has taken a keen interest in making sure his house is in order.” Statement issued by Parliament on behalf of the Chairperson of Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services, Dr Mathole Motshekga, 25 February 2018
