MEDIA STATEMENT BY PATRICIA DE LILLE Based on media reports today, it has come to my attention that criminal charges have apparently been laid against me by the Democratic Alliance. I have not been formally notified of these charges by the South African Police Service (SAPS). Should criminal charges have been laid against me, I will cooperate openly and transparently with the SAPS. I deny and reject the reported allegations with the contempt it deserves. Should criminal charges have been laid against me, I will cooperate openly and transparently with the SAPS. I deny and reject the reported allegations with the contempt it deserves. Why did he wait almost five years to make these allegations? This seems to be the latest of a string of moves to taint my name by clutching at anything and informing the media before allegations are properly tested. I have repeatedly asked for a fair process yet the handling of this matter and the treatment towards me are clearly attempts to sway public perception against me instead of giving me a fair opportunity to state my case and to test the allegations properly. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the concerted efforts to damage my reputation and the haste to get rid of me is reaching desperate heights each day.
