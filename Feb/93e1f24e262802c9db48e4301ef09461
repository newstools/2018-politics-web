Resignation of suspended Eskom Group Executive for Generation, Mr Matshela Koko Friday, 16 February 2018: Eskom has today received a resignation letter from Mr Matshela Koko stating that he has decided to resign with immediate effect. Mr Koko’s resignation comes against the back drop of serious charges of misconduct that were levelled against him and that would have been adjudicated at his disciplinary hearing which commenced today. The charges against Mr Koko related to grave misconduct.  Mr Koko’s resignation was only tendered after the disciplinary hearing into these charges had commenced. Eskom would have preferred to continue with the disciplinary process so that Mr Koko could be held to account for any proven wrong-doing. Eskom however accepted that this practically could not be pursued in light of clear legal precedent that a resignation by an employee unilaterally terminates the employment relationship. Eskom has as result accepted Mr Koko’s resignation with immediate effect, however reserves all its rights to institute legal action in respect of any damages Eskom has suffered arising from Mr Koko’s actions at Eskom and to enforce its legal rights under the Pension Funds Act. Eskom reiterates its belief that Mr Koko’s resignation during his disciplinary hearing came in the face of serious charges of misconduct on the back of which Eskom would have sought a sanction to summarily dismiss him. The Board of Eskom remains committed to its mandate to root out malfeasance and maladministration as a critical foundation to restoring transparent and effective governance. As indicated at the Interim results presentation, a key focus for the new Board has been addressing governance related matters as a matter of urgency and the termination of Eskom’s employment relationship with Mr Koko today is a critical step in the journey of renewal, inculcating business discipline and accountability.
