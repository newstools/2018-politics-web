Police find 8 more missing Esidimeni patients 20 February 2018 I have been informed by the police that they have found 8 more former patients from Life Esidimeni who were listed as missing by the Gauteng Health Department. Four of the patients were found at the Thuli Home Centre in Orange Farm and two were found at the San Michele Mental Institution in Kwa-Thema. One patient was taken to an unknown institution according to his nephew, and another was moved by her mother who refuses to say where she is but confirms she is still alive. The police have now resolved 13 of the 62 missing person cases that I opened with them last month, including one who is deceased for unexplained reasons. This leaves 49 who still need to be found, 27 of whom do not have ID numbers and seven without full names so it will be very difficult to trace them. The best way to find them would be by publicizing any photographs that are  available, but the Gauteng Health Department has puzzlingly not taken this step.
