#DefeatDayZero: I celebrate further push-back of Day Zero 5 February 2018 I celebrate the news that Day Zero has been pushed back to mid-May 2018. This shows that it is possible to #DefeatDayZero if we all work together. This significant victory is thanks in large part to the continued heroic water saving efforts of the residents and businesses of Cape Town; as well as a sharp reduction of agricultural drawdowns. If we all keep on saving water and focus on using less than 50l per day, we can move Day Zero even further back and defeat it altogether. I congratulate and thank all Capetonians for their efforts to Defeat Day Zero. Issued by Mmusi Maimane, Leader of the Democratic Alliance, 5 February 2018
