Justice and Correctional Services Committee calls Public Protector to explain public utterances 11 February 2018 Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has decided to urgently call the Public Protector, Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane to appear before the Committee to explain her statements in public over the recent weeks. Committee Chairperson, Dr Mathole Motshekga, said the Committee is extremely concerned with these comments and needs clarity on “what exactly she is trying to convey. We have further noted with grave concern allegations of her office suppressing some evidence. This type of allegations only tarnishes the good image of the office of the Public Protector.” Dr Motshekga said it was therefore decided to call Adv. Mkwhebane to address the Committee on Wednesday on all matters that are currently in the public domain as put in this space by her office as it is of concern to the Committee and South Africans in general.
