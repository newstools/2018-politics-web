FF Plus welcomes decision to remove Zuma tomorrow with motion of no confidence 14 February 2018 The FF Plus welcomes the fact that the process of recalling President Jacob Zuma has been finalised and that he will be removed as South Africa’s Head of State tomorrow by means of a motion of no confidence. The whole process was unduly drawn-out and the clumsy way in which the ANC dealt with the matter over the past few weeks serves as proof that the ANC government is not capable of properly managing crises or the country. Further proof that the ANC is incompetent is their present crisis management, they want to have the State of the Nation Address (SONA) this coming Friday if a new president is elected and sworn in tomorrow. In addition, it seems like there will be only one day devoted to debating the SONA in Parliament. In the past, two days were set aside for this. Suh a decision will affect opposition parties adversely. If the ANC had not decided to cancel the meeting of its National Executive Committee (NEC) last Wednesday, South Africa’s new president could already have been sworn in. The FF Plus will support the motion of no confidence against Zuma. Issued by Pieter Groenewald,FF Plus leader, 14 February 2018
