Stockpiling municipal water could bring Day Zero closer again 14 February 2018 With the dams supplying the City of Cape Town critically low at 24,7% of capacity, we cannot afford any action that could jeopardise the little bit of water that we have left. This is irrespective of the fact that Day Zero has moved out to 4 June 2018. The stockpiling of municipal water threatens our water-saving effort and residents are urged not to engage in this practice. ‘Water users should use no more than 50 litres per person per day. This is absolutely necessary for us to reduce our collective usage to 450 million litres per day and to ensure that we stretch our water supplies into the winter months and beyond. We are nearing this target and we cannot give up now. We are confident that Team Cape Town will show South Africa and the rest of the world how to beat a drought. ‘However, if you are getting by with less than your 50 litres and stockpiling that, it goes against the new relationship with water that we are all trying to establish. If you are using or stockpiling municipal water above your allocation, it is an illegal act and doing so will bring Day Zero closer again. This will also mean that you will pay hefty tariffs for high municipal water usage,’ said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services; and Energy, Councillor Xanthea Limberg.
