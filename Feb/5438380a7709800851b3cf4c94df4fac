Zuma must get his day in court 15 February 2018 Despite the fact that the former President, Jacob Zuma, resigned of his own accord, he must still get his day in court – just like he always wanted. With his resignation, he tried to paint himself as a martyr that only wanted to serve South Africa and the people and he even bragged about how he faithfully kept to the Constitution’s prescripts and that he always put the interests of the country and its citizens first. However, quite the opposite is true as the Constitutional Court found that Zuma violated the Constitution. The Constitution stipulates that it is the president’s duty to promote unity and social cohesion in South Africa, but Zuma went out of his way to incite racial polarisation by repeatedly blaming white people for the country’s problems, the majority of which he actually created. An example of this is his assertion that the country’s problems started with the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck as well as his statements about white monopoly capital and that white people stole the land. With these remarks, he created racial tension and violated his Constitutional duty. The investigation into state capture must be concluded speedily and Zuma’s involvement must be laid bare. If it is decided that he will be prosecuted, then he can have his day in court – just like he asked. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus Leader, 15 February 2018
