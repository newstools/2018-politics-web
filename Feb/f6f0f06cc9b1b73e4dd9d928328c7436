The motion was submitted in accordance with Rule 18.1.1. of the Rules of Order Regulating the Conduct of Meetings at the Municipal Council of the City of Cape Town, in that it was submitted to my Office, signed by the member submitting it, and by the member seconding it. Section 29(1) of the Local Government Municipal Structures Act 117 of 1998, regarding meetings of municipal councils, prescribes that: The speaker of a municipal council decides when and where the council meets subject to section 18(2), but if a majority of the councillors requests the speaker in writing to convene a council meeting, the speaker must convene a meeting at a time set out in the request. As such, I will convene a Special Council sitting on 15 February 2018. Statement issued by Alderman Dirk Smit, Speaker: City of Cape Town, 2 February 2018
