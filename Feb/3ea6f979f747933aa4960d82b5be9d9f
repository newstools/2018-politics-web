Statement on the recall of President Zuma by the ANC 13 February 2018 The South African Communist Party warmly welcomes the fact that the African National Congress headed Alliance is at last at one about the urgent necessity for President Jacob Zuma to resign and, if not, to be recalled. To this end the SACP further welcomes the ANC National Executive Committee decision to recall President Zuma in order to speed up the pace of resolving the many challenges facing our government and society as a whole. The decision should pave the way to a deep-going, decisive self-correction and greater ANC and Alliance unity to revitalise democratic support from lost ground towards greater heights. The immediate tasks moving forward include dismantling the parasitic networks surrounding our state and movement and deal decisively with corporate state capture and other forms of corruption. This must be guided by an intensified effort to selflessly serve the people exceptionally and solve their problems with loyalty. Priority must be placed on radically reducing, and eventually eliminating high levels of class, race and gender inequalities and uneven development between urban and rural areas, unemployment, poverty and social insecurity. The work must be buttressed by a speedy reconfiguration of the Alliance, principled and programmatic unity to ensure that a reconfigured ANC headed Alliance decisively wins elections in 2019 and beyond.
