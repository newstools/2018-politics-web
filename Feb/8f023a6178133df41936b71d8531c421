EFF welcomes Patricia de Lille's victory as a defence of black leadership 15 February 2018 The EFF welcomes the victory of Patricia De Lille against efforts by the DA to remove her as Mayor of the Cape Town Metro. The EFF caucus in the Cape Metro openly voted for her as a defence of black leadership. In essence, it is the EFF that made sure she remains mayor when the white supremacists were trying to bully her out of the metro and its council. The EFF is aware that DA wanted to removeÂ De Lille because she did not want to sign two contracts for desalination plants which amounted to R834 million and R6 billion respectively. The DA wanted these contracts because upon their approval, they could score R600 million funding for their election campaign in 2019 from the Israelis. The EFF would never agree to this and we caution the DA that it too like the ANC will fall flat on its knees because of corruption. They are rendering themselves irrelevant as a party that can be trusted with the public purse because they use it to raise money from apartheid Israeli based companies.
