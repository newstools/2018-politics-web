DA condemns sexual abuse of learners at Klerksdorp Primary School 19 February 2018 The Democratic Alliance in Matlosana strongly condemns the disgusting violation against 30 learners in Klerksdorp who were allegedly sexually assaulted by their teacher. The DA will write to the MEC for Education, Sello Lehari, requesting him to ensure that all affected learners receive counseling and assistance to deal with this trauma. The learners allegedly told their parents that the grade 4 teacher touched them indecently on their private parts and hugged them very closely while pressing against their breasts. It is unacceptable that a teacher who is supposed to be a guardian would violate them in such a manner. The 2017 Crime Statistics report revealed that sexual offenses in the North West province showed an increase of 3.9% - the highest hike in South Africa. The DA urges the South African Police Services (SAPS) to conduct a thorough investigation and ensure that justice is served for the victims. We urge parents and teachers to continue educating learners on issues surrounding sexual abuse and to encourage them to report any sexual infringement they may experience. Children should be protected against sexual abuse, it is within their rights as enshrined in the Constitution of South Africa. South Africans had enough of crime and want to see suspects brought to justice. Our children are our future and should have an opportunity to learn in a safe and healthy environment.
