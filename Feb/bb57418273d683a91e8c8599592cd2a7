ANC Statement on the postponement of the State of the Nation Address 6 February 2018 The African National Congress notes and respects the decision of the President of the Republic of South Africa in consultation with the Presiding Officers of Parliament to postpone the Joint Sitting of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces; intended for the tabling of the State of the Nation Address. We understand that this decision was arrived at based on a shared understanding that there is a need to deliver this important address in a conducive political environment. The ANC maintains its commitment to providing leadership to the Republic of South Africa in a manner that reinforces confidence in public institutions such as Parliament. It is for this reason that the ANC Caucus, represented by the Chief Whip, in the meeting of the Presiding Officers and all political parties, also motivated for the postponement of the scheduled Joint Sitting in light of the growing anxieties in the public domain. As previously announced, the ANC will convene its Special National Executive Committee in Cape Town. The NEC will also reflect on this decision by the President and the Presiding Officers to postpone the State Of the Nation Address and provide direction on how the ANC will assist their efforts to create a conducive political environment as they intend.
