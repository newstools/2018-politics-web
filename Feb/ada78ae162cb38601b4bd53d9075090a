Eskom confirms status of Optimum Coal Mine Thursday, 22 February 2018: Optimum coal mine that supplies Hendrina Power Station in Mpumalanga informed Eskom that they have commenced with business rescue proceedings on Monday 19 February. Eskom has fully complied with its contractual obligations to Optimum Colliery. In January 2018 Optimum Coal Mine failed to meet its contractual deliveries to Hendrina Power Station. This has led to Eskom imposing a failure to supply penalty. The penalty amount exceeded the invoice amount from Optimum coal mine. Coal has not been delivered to Eskom since workers at the mine downed their tools yesterday, 22 February 2018. In mitigation, Eskom has diverted coal from other mines to supply Hendrina Power Station. Eskom will continue to focus on the energy availability of the rest of the fleet to ensure reliability of supply. Statement issued by Eskom, 22 February 2018
