EFF welcomes the postponement of SONA as a victory towards removal of ZUMA 6 February 2018 The EFF welcomes the postponement of the State of the Nation Address scheduled to take place on 06 February 2018. We welcome this as a move towards the removal of Zuma from the highest office in the land. We reiterate our call for the Motion of No Confidence to take place before SONA. We know that even if the ANC NEC were to recall him, Zuma will not step down. In his hearts of hearts, he wishes that chaos erupts should he be forced to step down. Knowing that his destination is prison, Zuma wants to go down with chaos, he must be forced down, and demonstrated to, that there will not be any chaos. Zuma will end up in prison not because anyone hates him, but because he has been working hard, in his own volition, to end up in jail. Issued by Mbuyiseni Quintin Ndlozi, 6 February 2018
