DA requests NPA and IPID to update Parliament on the Marikana prosecution following new evidence 12 February 2018 The DA will request the Chairperson of the Police Committee, Francois Beukman, to invite the Executive Director of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) Robert McBride and National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) director, Shawn Abrahams, to Parliament to update the public on the status of the dockets relating to the death of 34 mineworkers at Marikana on 16 August 2012. The public deserves to know if new evidence from the South African Police Service (SAPS) members who confessed to shooting striking mineworkers in Marikana will be included in the NPA’s prosecution flowing from IPID's investigation. The IPID and NPA must track these SAPS members and interview them in order find more evidence with regard to Scene 2 during the Marikana massacre. The DA is of the view that these new revelations will assist in terms of bringing closure to the families of the victims. It is also imperative for the nation to understand on whose orders these SAPS members were acting. The family of those who were killed senselessly will never rest until justice is served. With the new evidence surfacing, everyone responsible, no matter their political position, must be held to account. The DA appeals to other SAPS members to come forward with more information or any evidence which can potentially impact the process of the Marikana trial.
