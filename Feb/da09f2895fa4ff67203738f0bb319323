'The law is blind, it does not matter who it is' - Mbalula on Gupta compound raid 14 February 2018 Cape Town - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula would not be drawn on the details of the Hawks' early morning raid at the Gupta family's compound in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, on Wednesday morning. Mbalula addressed media in Parliament following the ANC's emergency caucus meeting after which it was announced that the ruling party would support a motion of no confidence against the president on Thursday. Mbalula said he wanted to limit his comments as he was still waiting for an update from the Hawks. "But I think they will communicate whatever that they need to communicate on our behalf," he said. "We will be able to confirm the activities of this morning once we are properly informed, once the thing is done, and we will speak about it at a later stage. "I'm the boss, I know everything," Mbalula said. He denied rumours that President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, would be arrested soon. "I don't think that carries any truth." Mbalula said the Hawks would be able to confirm rumours of who was arrested in the early morning raid as well as when and where they would be appearing in court. "Before the end of the day the Hawks should be able to relay that to you," he said. "I will prefer the Hawks give you information and then I will issue you a statement. We all know that there has been raids in some house in Johannesburg. To us the law is blind, it does not matter who it is." Mbalula said the police had to continue doing their jobs "without fear or favour". News24
