DA en EFF’s planned motion to get rid of Zuma may have the opposite effect 31 January 2018 Even though the FF Plus supports Zuma’s removal as head of state of the country, the DA and EFF’s request for the speaker to table another motion of no confidence in the President ahead of the State of the Nation address is premature and opportunistic, says Dr Pieter Groenewald. Dr Groenewald says that it can also have the opposite effect and may contribute to strengthening Zuma’s position as no political party will allow other parties to make such important decisions on its behalf. “The ANC must get its house in order and must decide for itself when and how they want to get rid of the President. The behaviour of the DA and EFF is not making a positive contribution to the process of removing Zuma. “Their behaviour may actually cause the ANC to unite as no political party will allow another party to get rid of its governing president. This has been proven over and over with the previous eight motions of no confidence in Zuma. “In the Cape Town Metro Council, the DA did not support a motion by the ANC for the very same reason, despite the fact that the DA wants to get rid of its mayor, Patricia De Lille. “If the DA and the EFF really are serious about having Zuma ousted, they should not bring in more motions of no confidence, but should give the ANC the chance to decide what they want to do and then let them do it. “The behaviour of the DA and the EFF may even create the impression that they actually want to ensure that President Zuma stays on as head of state seeing as that would be to their advantage with the 2019 elections,” says Dr Groenewald.
