Weak action against Zuma indicates great internal disunity in the ANC 13 February 2018 The ANC’s hesitation to take strong action to get rid of President Jacob Zuma points to great internal disunity in the ruling party and to the fact that the ANC leadership is afraid that the party might split if stronger action is taken against the President,” says Dr Pieter Groenewald, leader of the FF Plus. Dr Groenewald says that it is unacceptable that the ANC is allowing Zuma to keep holding the country hostage and the dawdling in getting rid of him clearly shows that the ANC is not able to govern the country as they can't even resolve their own internal problems. According to Dr Groenewald, President Zuma was indeed recalled, but no-one knows when he will go. “It is simply unacceptable that the possibility remains that President Zuma can have his way and stay on as head of state for up to another six months, seeing as he is desperate enough to do just about anything, that will only further damage South Africa. There is also no guarantee that he will keep his word and resign his office after the said six months. “It is clear that the President is refusing to comply with the ANC’s request for him to resign. As a result, parliament will have to take action against him, most probably by means of a motion of no confidence. “It is, however, of the utmost importance that the ANC will table the motion seeing as the ruling party will not support the motion of no confidence tabled by an opposition party, in this case the EFF. If the EFF really is serious about getting rid of the President, they will withdraw their motion. “It is sad that a head of state that has no credibility to speak of and that has caused so much damage to the economy and the relations between people in the country, is allowed to hold onto his position of power,” says Dr Groenewald.
