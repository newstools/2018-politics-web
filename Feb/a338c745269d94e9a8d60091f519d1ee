EFF CALLS ON MKHWEBANE TO STEP DOWN FOLLOWING THE HIGH COURT RULING ON ABSA AND SARB Friday, February 16, 2018 The EFF calls on Adv. Mkhwebane to step down from the office of the Public Protector following the damning outcomes of the Gauteng South High Court on her incompetence. The High Court ordered that she pays 15% of the legal bill for Absa and the SARB from her own pocket. The court openly said that it was clear Adv. Mkhwebane does not fully understand her constitutional duty to be impartial. This is due to not disclosing her meetings with state President and state security during the court process and investigations. If this important office is to have integrity it cannot be occupied by people who lie or are misleading. Above all, who are impartial and hellbent on undermining the mandate of the office and the constitution. We call on her to step down with immediate effect; this judgment means she has failed in her duty. Failure by Adv. Mkhwebane to step down, the EFF will initiate a parliamentary process in terms of section 194 of the Constitution. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 16 February 2018
