DA exploring options against Inxeba censorship Note to Editors: Please find attached a soundbite by the DA Shadow Minister of Communications, Phumzile Van Damme MP. The DA  rejects the Film and Publications Board's (FPB) Appeal Tribunal's report on the reasoning behind the decision to reclassify the film Inxeba to a rating of X18. The report has stated that "The target market, which in our view is the 16years old is not reasonable familiar with the practises of initiation schools as described by the appellants [and that] preexposure to such acts of sexual conduct is harmful and disturbing to this age group." Furthermore the report states that: "The following classifiable elements were agreed to by classification committee, i.e language which is frequent and moderate to story. The violence is mild to moderate and fairly frequent. The nudity is low impact and infrequent. Sexual related activity inclusive of anal and oral sex were found to be mild to moderate impact and fairly frequent." These are simply not sufficient reasons to give Inxeba such a harsh rating and the FPB can be assured that this decision will not go unchallenged. The DA is currently exploring our options to fight what is a violations of the Constitutional right of freedom of  expression, including artistic creativity. The FPB's rating is nothing short of censorship. The producers of this film have been brave in exploring daring and important themes and stories, that many others have been too afraid to explore. The DA commends their bravery and we will explore every option to ensure that every South African con watch Inxeba at cinemas across the country.
