DA requests that the Public Service Commission investigates Muthambi for alleged abuse of office The Democratic Alliance has written to the Public Service Commission (PSC) asking that they launch an investigation into possible abuse of office by the Minister of Public Service and Administration, Faith Muthambi. This follows allegations that her private office has grown to 40 people, some of which include friends and family. Among these controversial appointments are Cliff Bopape who was hired as a ‘protocol officer’ while Jack Matlala former Limpopo MPLs became her speechwriter with an two spokespersons allegedly in her office. Worse still, she has been accused of purging her department, most notably her former Director General Mashwahle Diphofa. The allegations facing Minister Muthambi are serious and a direct contravention of the Ministerial Handbook which mandates her to only have 10 appointments in her private office. The PSC, as the statutory body empowered to investigate personnel practices the public service, must take urgent steps to test the veracity of these allegations. South Africans need full disclosure on who is hired to work in Minister Muthambi’s office, their role and the number of staff members thereof. It is not enough for the PSC to take her on her word that the allegations against her are not true. A formal inquiry must be instituted to ensure that these supposed acts of impropriety are investigated. The DA is confident that the PSC will accede to our request and the allegations against Muthambi are investigated in transparent manner without fear or favor.
