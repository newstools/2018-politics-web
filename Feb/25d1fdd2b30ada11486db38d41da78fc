DA prepares to make submissions to the State Capture Inquiry 9 February 2018 The DA welcomes the release of the Regulations for the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, as gazetted this afternoon. The wheels are now finally in motion to begin the process of holding those responsible for state capture accountable. President Jacob Zuma has for years frustrated the efforts to hold him to account for his seemingly corrupt relationship with the Guptas. Seeing that his schedule might soon become lighter, there is no excuse for Zuma to be not the first witness to appear before the Commission. In addition to President Zuma, the Gupta family, Duduzane Zuma, Ace Magashule, and Mosebenzi Zwane must all be summoned to testify before the Commission as they were among the leading figures in the capture of our state. We are hopeful that Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo and his team will now kick into gear without further delay, as all those implicated in State Capture have gone far too long without being held accountable for their crimes. The DA also looks forward to making our submissions to the Commission of Inquiry. Issued by Glynnis Breytenbach, DA Shadow Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, 9 February 2018
