Only Parliament can ‘recall’ Zuma 13 February 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the decision by the ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) to recall Jacob Zuma. This recall is an internal ANC resolution, and nothing more. It has no effect on Jacob Zuma’s current status as President of the Republic, and can be simply ignored by Zuma. Unless he tenders his resignation, this recall is not worth the paper it is printed on. The fact is, Jacob Zuma remains President, and remains in power. And as long as this is the case, our country suffers. The only way to remove Jacob Zuma as President of our country is for Parliament to do so through a Motion of No Confidence. It is Parliament that elects and removes a President, not the ANC. Therefore, the EFF’s Motion of No Confidence, provisionally scheduled for 22 February, must be treated as a priority and brought forward to within this week, in order for Parliament to remove Jacob Zuma. Following that, the National Assembly must dissolve Parliament in terms of Section 50 of the Constitution. Anyone who wants to be the next President of this country must have the mandate of the people, and this can only be established through an early election. The people must elect the new South African President, not a few connected cadres within the ANC. Issued by Mmusi Maimane, Leader of the Democratic Alliance, 13 February 2018
