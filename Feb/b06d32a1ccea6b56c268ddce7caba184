A new beginning for KZN Today the Democratic Alliance held its Provincial Congress at Olive Convention Centre. This is the first step towards bringing about a new beginning for the people of KZN. More than 600 delegates ascended to elect the new leadership that will usher in the DA government in KZN. The DA has demonstrated its strength in the province by constantly marking its footprint across the province. The Local Government Elections proved once again that our growth is not limited to the urban areas. The DA has set its sights on bringing the ANC below 50% in 2019, and the Party will unite and work together towards achieving this. Below is the new Provincial Leadership: Provincial Leader: Zwakele Mncwango Provincial Deputy Leader: Mergan Chetty MP Provincial Chairperson: Francois Rodgers MPL Provincial Deputy Chairpersons: Hlengiwe Shozi, Craig Millar, Shehana Kajee The party is confident that this leadership will bring in the new beginning that KZN has been waiting for.
