Lesufi is acting like a naughty child and he will hit a brick wall 31 January 2018 The Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi, is acting like a naughty, stubborn child that just won’t listen and he will hit a brick wall with his attempt to approach the Constitutional Court in relation to the Hoërskool Overvaal case, says Philip van Staden, FF Plus MPL in the Gauteng Legislature. Van Staden says that Lesufi’s latest attempt will simply be a waste of tax payers’ money seeing as the High Court’s ruling in the Overvaal case did not touch on Constitutional issues, but only determined that the school could not admit extra learners as it was filled to capacity. “The FF Plus is of the opinion that Lesufi’s political agenda is busy unravelling and that he is trying to shift the focus away from his own incompetency and inability to properly manage the Department. He should rather concentrate on performing his primary tasks by ensuring that enough schools are built and that enough teachers are appointed in the province. “Lesufi will do anything to have his way, at the cost of the tax payer. He is busy endangering children’s lives by allowing protest actions to take place at schools; all in an attempt to impose his will on the residents of Gauteng. “The FF Plus believes that Lesufi’s application to the Constitutional Court will not be successful. He should rather heed the statements made by the national Minister of Education, Angie Motshekga, who said that Afrikaans still has a place in schools and that Afrikaans must not be done away with. “The time has come for Minister Motshekga to take action and put Lesufi in his place, seeing as the Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, will not do what needs to be done. In the interim, Lesufi is causing needless racial tension in Gauteng,” says Van Staden. Issued by Philip van Staden, FF Plus MPL: Gauteng Legislature, 31 January 2018
