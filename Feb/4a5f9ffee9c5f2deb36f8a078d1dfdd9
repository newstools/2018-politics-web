Parliament statement on EFF request for rescheduling of Motion of No Confidence 12 February 2018 Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Mr Lechesa Tsenoli, on behalf of Speaker Ms Baleka Mbete, has responded to the request from the Leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Mr Julius Malema to reschedule the EFF’s motion of no confidence in the President to 13 February. In the letter to Mr Malema and the attorneys of the EFF, Ms Mbete said she was currently consulting on the request to reschedule the motion and would revert after this. The Rules of the National Assembly entailed consultation with relevant structures, including the Chief Whip of the Majority Party and the Leader of Government Business. Ms Mbete originally scheduled the motion for 22 February. This was after consulting with the Chief Whip of the Majority Party and the Leader of Government Business and obtaining confirmation for the 22 February scheduling from the National Assembly Programme Committee. In her letter today, Ms Mbete said she was currently consulting on the request and would revert to Mr Malema. Reports that the Speaker had rejected the EFF’s request to schedule the Motion of No Confidence on 13 February are, therefore, false. Issued by Moloto Mothapo on behalf of Parliament, 12 February 2018
