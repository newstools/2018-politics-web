Presidency underscores importance of community consultation on Mining Charter 19 February 2018 The Presidency welcomes the indefinite postponement by the North Gauteng High Court of an application by the Chamber of Mines and seven mining community networks against the Mining Charter. Among other prospects, this judgment enables all stakeholders concerned to address the concern by representatives of mining affected communities that they had not been properly engaged on an agreement between the Chamber of Mines and the Department of Mineral Resources on the postponement of the court application which was heard today, Monday 19 February 2018. The Presidency reaffirms its commitment to ensure that communities are integrally involved in consultations not only on the Mining Charter, but on all matters relating to the development of this sector. It reiterates what President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his State of the Nation Address that government is determined to work with mining companies, unions and communities to grow the mining sector, attract new investment, create jobs and set the industry on a new path of transformation and sustainability. “This year, we will intensify engagements with all stakeholders on the Mining Charter to ensure that it is truly an effective instrument to sustainably transform the face of mining in South Africa,” he said. It is regrettable that there was insufficient consultation on the issue of the postponement. Government will ensure that this matter is corrected in engagement on the Mining Charter going forward.
