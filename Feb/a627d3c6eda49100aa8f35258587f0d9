EFF NOTES THE ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION OF RAMAPHOSA AS PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA Thursday, February 15, 2018 The EFF notes the illegitimate election of Cyril Ramaphosa as President of the Republic of South Africa. We see it as an illegitimate move because parliament should cleanse itself of all the Constitutional Court rulings that have found it to be in violation of the constitution in that it failed to hold the executive accountable. This failure to hold the executive accountable means there can not be a new cabinet that rises out of this parliament with legitimacy. The departure of Zuma should necessarily mean this parliament which protected him when he violated the constitution must fall and a new one should rise with a renewed mandate from our electorate. Ramaphosa's rise despite this reality should mean he is afraid of the electorate and wishes to fulfil his immediate career interests. To rise without a popular election means this is a mere elite pact which does not have the democratic blessings of our people. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 15 February 2018
