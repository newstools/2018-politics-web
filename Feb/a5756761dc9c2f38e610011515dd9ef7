PSC agrees to DA request to investigate Minister Faith Muthambi 8 January 2018 The DA welcomes the decision taken by the Public Service Commission’s (PSC) to launch an investigation into possible abuse of office by the Minister of Public Service and Administration, Faith Muthambi. See the PSC letter here. On 2 February 2018, we wrote to the PSC asking that an investigation be conducted to test allegations that Minister Muthambi had expanded her private office to 40 people, some of whom include family and friends. The PSC is mandated to investigate personnel practices in the Public service in terms of section 196 (4)(f)(i) of the constitution. The allegations against Muthambi are such that she may have violated the Ministerial handbook; which only makes provision for 10 appointees in the Ministers’ private office. For far too long, Minister Muthambi has ‘got away with murder’ in her brazen attempt to turn the Ministry into an employment agency for the politically connected few. Money that could have been better spent creating a more accessible Public Service, was diverted to hire excess food aides, drivers and administration assistants. Minister Muthambi’s behaviour has been enabled by an ineffectual leader of government business, Cyril Ramaphosa, who has turned a blind eye while the rot festered. The DA looks forward to a timely conclusion of this investigation and appropriate sanction that would reign in Minister Muthambi’s abuse of office to please the politically connected few.
