954 defects in Rahima Moosa Hospital building 19 February 2018 The Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in west Johannesburg has 954 identified building defects and contravenes the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) in a number of areas. This is revealed by Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. According to Mamabolo, the hospital is 69 years old and “is ageing fairly well. Its condition is average”. But the following areas need repairs and/or upgrade: - Mechanical - the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is in poor condition, especially in theatres and the boilers - Electrical - there is a need for more plug points and better lighting - Roof - needs to be water-proofed throughout the facility - Windows and doors need maintenance Mamabolo says that there is R7.1 million in the budget this year for preventative maintenance at the hospital, but this money “is not enough to cater for all defects at this institution.” He says there is a “New Maintenance Approach which will include a rolling plan for three consecutive years”. I am greatly concerned that there is insufficient budget to fix all the defects and that the emergency fire escape, infection control and waste management contravene legislation on building safety. I hope that the new approach to maintenance ensures a proper refurbishment of this historic hospital so that it provides a safe and comfortable environment for mothers giving birth.
