Agri SA encouraged by public hearings on land expropriation 28 June 2018 Agri SA, with its various affiliates, has initiated its participation in the Constitutional Review Committee’s (CRC) public hearings on Land Expropriation without Compensation, which began in the Northern Cape and Limpopo this week. “Agri SA welcomed the strong leadership displayed by the committee chairperson, Vincent Smith, at the hearings in Marble Hall, Limpopo yesterday, when proceedings were disrupted by an unruly crowd of people. We encourage participants to exercise patience and engage in constructive discussion," said Omri van Zyl, Executive Director of Agri SA. Agri SA has already submitted its written submission to the CRC and our provincial affiliates have also taken the opportunity to participate in the public participation process. Henk van Wyk, President of Agri Northern Cape put Agri Northern Cape’s views across in Springbok, Northern Cape on Tuesday. Willem van Jaarsveld, the CEO of Agri Limpopo, expressed his concerns on Wednesday about the proposed amendment to section 25 of the Constitution at a public hearing in Marble Hall, Limpopo. “Section 25 is not the cause of the slow pace of land reform in South Africa. It is our concern that agriculture in Limpopo may be put in jeopardy, if there is a change in law,” Van Jaarsveld said to a packed Ephraim Mogale Town Hall. “We are committed to make it work for everybody in this country.” The public hearings will continue until August. Agri SA urge stakeholders to make use of the opportunities to air their views. Issued by Melissa Tighy, Communication Officer, Agri SA, 28 June 2018
