Parliament to conduct public hearings on the Party Funding Bill 19 June 2018 The Ad Hoc Committee on the Funding of Political Parties in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will this week hear verbal submissions including one by My Vote Counts. On 20 June 2018, My Vote Counts will be making a presentation on the Political Party Funding Bill. Of the many public submissions the Ad Hoc Committee on the Funding of Political Parties received, eight requested to address the committee verbally. We are calling for a number of amendments to the current state of the bill which are: The local government sphere be included to receive funding from the Multi-Party Democracy Fund (MPDF) That the allocation formula of the MPDF should be changed so that 50% is distributed proportionally and 50% equitably That members should not be allowed to personally receive political party donations Include to 'whom' the IEC must publish the information on parties' direct donations That information on political parties' investment vehicles should be regulated and disclosed Do not allow donors who donate to the MPDF to retain anonymity Do not allow foreign entities to donate to political parties for policy development Prohibit donations from companies that do business with the state Lower the ‘prescribed threshold’ for disclosure from R100 000 to R10 000 Lower the upper limit that a single donor can donate MVC has been advocating for the transparency of political party donors since 2012 as we believe it will discourage attempts to unduly influence public representatives and prevent corruption. This process is also important because it will provide for a transparent political environment that allows for voters to make an informed vote. We therefore urge the committee to practice due diligence and have this bill signed into law before the 2019 elections.
