DA welcomes reopening of Hlongwa Hawks investigation 27 June 2018 The DA welcomes the announcement by Hawks Spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi that they will reopen the crime docket against ANC Gauteng Chief Whip Brian Hlongwa. This follows the release of the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) report last week which implicates him in alleged corruption and fraud of R1.2 billion during his tenure as Gauteng Health MEC from 2006 to 2009. According to Mulaidzi, the Hawks had prepared a warrant for Hlongwa’s arrest, but the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) decided against executing it. This warrant against Hlongwa was issued in October 2014, but no satisfactory reason has been given for why it was withdrawn, which is why I suspect political interference in this case. Another excessive delay has been with the Asset Forfeiture Unit’s application four years ago to seize Hlongwa’s house in Bryanston which he bought for R7.2 million, allegedly with financial assistance from corrupt sources. There is such a mound of evidence against Hlongwa that it is simply not credible for him to repeatedly claim that he is entirely innocent in this matter. According to the #HlongwaMustGo “Hlongwa Monitor”, it is now SIX DAYS since the release of the SIU Report and he has still not been fired by Premier David Makhura. How many more days before he loses his R1.4 million a year Chief Whip position, and faces trial in a court of law? Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 27 June 2018
