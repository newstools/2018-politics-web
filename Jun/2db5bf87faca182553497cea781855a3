ANC Western Cape welcomes Minister of Police interventions in Western Cape taxi violence 25 June 2018 ANC Western Cape welcomes the efforts by the Minister of Police, Cde Bheki Cele over the weekend, bringing all stakeholders in the taxi industry, particularly the two rival taxi associations, Cata and Codeta, in order to signal his strong intentions if the parties continue to put the lives of commuters at risk. As the ANC we hope all stakeholders will heed the call of the minister and avoid a possible closure of various taxi ranks, which will affect many residents and businesses who are dependent on these taxi ranks to survive. We find it reprehensible as the ANC that 44 lives have been lost due to the taxi violence since April. To lose so many innocent lives over 'taxi routes' between CATA and Codeta is unacceptable. We cannot allow such devaluing of human life over routes. We encourage the Police Minister to continue deploying tactical response teams at hotspots, at troubled taxi ranks, and at various routes. We must at all times put the lives of our people first. Issued by Faiez Jacobs, Provincial Secretary, ANC Western Cape, 25 June 2018
