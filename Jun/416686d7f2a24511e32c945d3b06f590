ANC-led Emfuleni throws away over R60 million The DA is shocked to learn that the ANC-led Emfuleni Local Municipality has wasted over R60 million on the purchasing of dustbins, grass cutting and cleaning campaigns. In our view this is a highly inflated price tag. This was revealed by the COGTA MEC, Uhuru Moiloa, in a written reply to DA questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. According to the MEC, the municipality contracted two service providers, the first was paid R29 575 742.32 for rolling out 240 dustbins and cleaning campaigns. The second service provider was paid R29 575 742.00 for the purchase of and distribution of 45 000 dustbins and grass cutting. This is part of the R206 842 207.00 spent on the Evaton Renewal Project thus far. Despite Emfuleni spending over R60 million on dustbins, grass cutting and cleaning campaigns there are still no proper waste collection services in Evaton. Evaton residents are suffering due to inadequate sanitation and many still make use of pit latrines. The Evaton Renewal Project was meant to uplift and improve the lives of residents by developing roads, improving sanitation, delivering housing and creating an environment conducive for the local economy to grow. There is nothing to show for the money spent on this project thus far. This is a clear indication that the ANC has failed to uplift the lives of Evaton residents. Residents are in dire need of Change, the kind of Change that only a DA-led government can deliver where the people’s money is spent on improving the lives of our poor people, not politicians and their allies.
