ANC collapses Emfuleni Municipality 5 June 2018 The DA welcomes the fact that the Emfuleni Municipality has been placed under administration as per section 139 (5)a of the Constitution. For far too long the residents of Emfuleni have suffered under the ANC-led municipality due to corruption and maladministration which impacted negatively on service delivery. The ANC cared little about the needs of the residents as they were looting from the poor. The residents have been denied adequate access to basic services like, water and electricity. Over the past year the residents of Emfuleni have been subjected to water restrictions due to the municipality defaulting on its Rand Water account. The Emfuleni Municipality has been put under administration for the following reasons: The ANC has collapsed Emfuleni Municipality as an institution; The ANC has dismally failed to address the rampant corruption within the Emfuleni Municipality; The ANC has dismally failed to render services to the residents of Emfuleni; and The ANC has no capacity to govern Emfuleni municipality Last year, Mayor Jacob Khawe who has since resigned was parachuted into the municipality to clean up the mess left by former sex-pest Mayor, Simon Mofokeng. During his 6 months in office, he has failed to do so. Given that this municipality has now been placed under administration it is clear that Emfuleni’s problem is the ANC. It is high time that residents of Emfuleni be given the services that they deserve. The DA will be closely monitoring the situation in Emfuleni and will apply pressure on the government to ensure that the residents receive the basic services that is guaranteed under the Constitution. While placing Emfuleni under administration is a welcome step, real change will only come through a DA-led Gauteng government. Only the DA places the people first.
