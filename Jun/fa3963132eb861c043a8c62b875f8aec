AfroVoice newspaper to shut down The AfroVoice newspaper, formerly known as the New Age, will no longer be in production with immediate effect, according to one staff member. AfroVoice journalist Vincent Cruywagen said that the news was announced by owner Mzwanele Manyi during a staff meeting on Wednesday. "He has asked all staff to stay at home until further notice, but promised he would pay our full July salaries," Cruywagen said. "I'm 56 years old. Where am I going to get a job? They can’t just pay one month’s salary." Manyi acquired the New Age and news channel ANN7, renamed Afro Worldview, from the controversial Gupta family in 2017. The publications were renamed in an attempt to break away from the Gupta’s scandalous reputation. Manyi was not available for comment despite several calls and messages. Two journalists from the publication's Johannesburg office confirmed to News24 that they had heard the rumour, but said that management had not told them anything yet. They said they were hoping to be integrated into the company's broadcaster Afro WorldView, formerly known as ANN7. News24
