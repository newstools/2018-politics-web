MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi, refuses to answer FF Plus’s question in Gauteng Legislature 28 June 2018 During a session of the Gauteng Legislature earlier today, the Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi, refused to even listen to and answer a question posed by the FF Plus. This transpired during the Budget Vote Debate of the Department of Education. The MEC boasted that a total of 43 new schools have been built in Gauteng since the 2014/15 financial year. The FF Plus MPL, Mr Philip van Staden, stood up and addressed the Speaker in terms of rule 77(5) of the standing rules of the Legislature, asking whether the MEC would be willing to answer a question by the FF Plus. The MEC responded by saying that he cannot understand why his voice is so loved and then denied the request. The FF Plus wanted to ask the MEC if the 43 new schools are operational and if not, why not as well as how many of the schools are indeed operational. The party also wanted to ask Lesufi how many Afrikaans schools there are left in Gauteng and how many of the new schools are Afrikaans. The way the MEC behaved toward the FF Plus today only goes to show that the MEC is not willing to answer uncomfortable questions and that he is surely trying to hide something. The FF Plus is of the opinion that if Lesufi had nothing to hide, he would have faced the questions and provided satisfactory answers. The FF Plus considers Lesufi’s behaviour to be rude and reprehensible. Issued by Philip van Staden, FF Plus MPL: Gauteng Legislature, 28 June 2018
