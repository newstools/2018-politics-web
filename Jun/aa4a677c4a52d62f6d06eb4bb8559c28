Criminal charges laid against Joburg hospital vandals 27 June 2018 Criminal charges have been opened against those who violently disrupted the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital in the last two months. This was disclosed yesterday by Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in an oral reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. Ramokgopa said that the charges included malicious damage to property, intimidation and attempted murder. Police are looking at the footage of the CCTV cameras to identify the perpetrators. I hope that the police do a proper investigation that can secure convictions in court as past perpetrators of violence at health facilities have gotten off because of police incompetence in collecting evidence. There should be tough consequences for those who trash a hospital and threaten staff and patients in what should be a place of healing without any violence.
