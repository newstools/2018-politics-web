ANCWL statement on public hearings hosted by Joint Constitutional Review Committee 28 June 2018 The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) is pleased by reports that majority of South Africans in particular women attend and actively participate in the current public hearings into a possible review of section 25 of the Constitution hosted by Joint Constitutional Review Committee. Women must fearlessly and unapologetically be in the forefront of influencing the policy position on land expropriation. Post 1994,  there are still entrenched racial and patriarchal systems on land ownership in South Africa. This skewed  patterns of ownership of land which promotes amongst others racism and patriarchy must be eradicated. South Africa cannot achieve equal society when access, control and ownership of land still remains the domain of white and male privilege due to some continuing  racial, cultural and traditional beliefs. ANCWL calls all its members and supporters to attend all the public hearings to advance the resolution of ANC 54th national conference. Any freedom without access, control and ownership of land is incomplete freedom. Land remains the key in advancing radical socio-economic transformation.
