DA reports Joe Gqabi Municipality Speaker to Commission for Gender Equality The Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (DAWN) is appalled by a recent incident where the Speaker of the Joe Gqabi District Municipality (JGDM),  Themba Notyeke Cllr, attacked a woman at an ANC event in Aliwal North. In a video clip of the incident that took place three weeks ago, Notyeke can be seen shoving a woman over a table after an altercation broke out. See video here. The victim of the attack has since laid charges against Notyeke. This treatment is blatant and sexist abuse by a person known to be arrogant and dismissive during council meetings. It is untenable that a person in his position gets away with treating a woman this way. The DA has therefore reported these allegations to the Commission for Gender Equality and asked the commission to make recommendations on appropriate further steps. DAWN will also consider laying criminal charges against Notyeke. My colleague Marina van Zyl, DA Caucus Leader in the JGDM, on Thursday successfully tabled a Motion Without Notice during an Ordinary Council Meeting in Barkley East, proposing that the attack by the Speaker be referred to the Rules and Ethics Committee. If the Speaker is found guilty, he should be removed as he would no longer be fit to lead the council. See motion here. We are heading into Women's Month in August, and the DA condemns any violence, especially towards women and children. Such behaviour by a public representative should not be ignored and left unpunished. South Africa needs the kind of change that protects women and children, and those found guilty of abusing women and children are held accountable.
