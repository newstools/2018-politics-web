DA announces changes to KZN Legislature Caucus line-up 21 June 2018 The Democratic Alliance in the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature has today announced several changes to its Caucus line-up. The changes come as a result of Chief Whip Mark Steele’s retirement. As a former Msunduzi Councillor and Caucus Chief Whip (2006 – 2009), National Assembly MP serving on SCOPA (2009 – 2011), Member of the KZN Legislature since 2011 and DA KZN Legislature Chief Whip since 2014, Honourable Steele has served the DA with distinction. He will remain a member of the DA and will continue to assist the party in whichever way he can. The departure of the Chief Whip also sees a restructuring of the Caucus leadership, with the following changes taking place with immediate effect: - Zwakele Mncwango, MPL becomes Leader of the DA Caucus in the KZN Legislature and the Leader of the Official Opposition - Francois Rodgers, MPL takes up the position of DA Caucus Chief Whip - Hlanagani Gumbi retains his position as Caucus Deputy Whip On behalf of the DA, I also wish to thank Francois Rodgers for his solid leadership of the Caucus over the past 18 months. We welcome his acceptance of the role of Chief Whip where his significant expertise will be of great value to Members as we strive to reach even greater heights. The changes to the DA’s Legislature team line-up have been made in order to offer the people of KZN the best possible official opposition team as the DA works towards achieving a Change of government in KZN in 2019. We will be working day and night to ensure that we build one South Africa for all based on the universal values of Freedom, Fairness, Opportunity and Diversity. The people of KZN deserve much better than the ANC. They deserve the kind of change that only a DA-led government can deliver, where jobs are created; there’s order and peace; and a zero tolerance approach to corruption. Issued by Zwakele Mncwango, Leader of the DA in the KZN Legislature, 21 June 2018
