The ANC government has failed to successfully convert hostels into liveable family units for nearly 20 years 20 June 2018 Today, on our oversight visit to KwaMazibuko Hostel in Katlehong in the Ekurhuleni Metro, the DA was shocked by the conditions that the ANC government is forcing people to live in. Despite R 750 000 budgeted for 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 for general maintenance, gardening and cleaning, there is very little evidence to show that this money has been spent to make a visible improvement to living conditions for the residents. It’s an assault on the dignity of the residents of the hostel that the ANC government has failed to upgrade and maintain hostel for nealy 20 years since making the announcement to convert hostels into family units. Broken windows, leaking sewerage, collapsed roofs and a failure to remove waste in the area exposes the residents to avoidable health hazards which shows the ANC’s uncaring attitude towards hostel residents. South Africans continue to live in conductions that are not fit for people to live in. Our people need access to quality and dignified housing but the uncaring ANC government has totally abandoned the people. Under a DA government, people will not be forced to suffer the consequences of a corrupt government which denies them a house to call a home. In 2019, South Africans will have the opportunity to exercise their right to choose a Party which can deliver dignified living conditions and safe housing.
