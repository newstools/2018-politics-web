Mahikeng Airport's contract with SA Express a smokescreen for money laundering 7 June 2018 It is with great shock that the Democratic Alliance in North West learned about the allegations of corruption and misuse of the people's money, linked to SA Express airline, former Premier, Supra Mahumapelo and the Department of Community Safety and Transport. It has been reported in the media that SA Express obtained a contract from the North West Provincial Government under the guise of economic development. In accordance with this agreement, a whopping R100 000 per passenger had been subsidised by the Department of Community Safety and Transport. The DA believes that these subsidies had shamelessly been used as a mechanism for looting the public purse to the tune of over R400 million. This information was revealed after a whistle-blower, who was granted a small contract, had witnessed over R51 million moving through her account, turning her into a conduit of money-laundering. The DA maintains that if found guilty, former Premier Supra Mahumapelo, along with all SA Express executives and Department of Community Safety and Transport officials involved in this fraudulent scheme, must be prosecuted and imprisoned. The DA further reiterates that this is political patronage at its worst. Fruitless and wasteful expenditure within the North West Province has escalated from R2 billion to a whopping R13.2 billion in just one year under former Premier Supra Mahumapelo’s watch. The bleeding North West deserves better. The DA will be approaching the office of the Public Protector to ensure that justice prevails. The DA will continue to address the plight of the poor by keeping criminals in the public sector accountable. Issued by Joe McGluwa, DA North West Provincial Leader, 7 June 2018
