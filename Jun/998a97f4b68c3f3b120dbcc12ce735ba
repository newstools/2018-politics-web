AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS STATEMENT ON THE BLATANT RACIST NATIONALISM OF THE EFF 6 May 2018 The African National Congress rejects with contempt the unprovoked and uncouth ambush on Comrade Ishmail Momoniat by Economic Freedom Fighters’ Deputy Chairperson, Floyd Shivhambu.  These comments are bordering on extreme racism, sow disunity and are an anathema to our agenda of forging a socially cohesive society. “I have known Comrade Momo Momoniat for over four decades and whilst I may differ sharply with some of his views on our economy’s developmental state, I could never stand aloof and allow him to be asked to leave a meeting because he is an Indian, said Comrade Jessie Duarte.  The blatant racist and narrow nationalist stance of the EFF is perhaps the only positive element of the irrational tirade by Shivhambu. His rant raises significant questions about the level of some Members of Parliament‘s comprehension of their responsibilities, to protect and defend the Constitution, particularly, the assertion that we build a non-racial, non-sexist and united Democratic South Africa. Duarte says “Comrade Momo is not and never will be racist and I say this without fear of contradiction, if anything, he is known to have been part of the underground struggle which afforded the Shivhambus of this world, the freedom to express their opinions albeit from a non-informed position. Momo is well known for showering every person with accolades or disdain in equal measure, irrespective of colour, class or creed." The ANC rejects Shivhambu’s racist and narrow nationalist diatribe with the deepest contempt it deserves.
