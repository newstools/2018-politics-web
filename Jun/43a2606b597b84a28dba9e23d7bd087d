South African Communist Party 17 June 2018 SACP welcomes intelligence review panel, calls for a similar review of the police crime intelligence, the police as a whole, including the Hawks, as well as the prosecution. The South African Communist Party welcomes President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appointment of a high-level review panel to assess the mandate, capacity and organisational integrity of the State Security Agency (SSA). The Presidency announced on Friday, 15 June 2018, that “the panel must seek to identify all material factors that allowed for some of the current challenges within the Agency so that appropriate measures are instituted to prevent a recurrence. The main objective of the review panel is to assist in ensuring a responsible and accountable national intelligence capability for the country in line with the Constitution and relevant legislation”. The SACP is pleased about the appointment of the panel on intelligence services. The panel must lay the basis for digging all the rot in the SSA and for a firm action to be taken against abuse of this state organ. All rogue intelligence activities must be exposed and uprooted from our SSA services. The SACP will be watching this process very closely. The SACP is calling for a similar review of the police crime intelligence, the police as a whole, including the Hawks, as well the prosecution, to establish how on earth the rot of corporate state capture took place as if these authorities were non-existent, and for a firm, corrective action to be taken.
