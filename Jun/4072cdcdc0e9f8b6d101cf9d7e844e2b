It’s all systems go for the DA Women’s Network 4 June 2018 Over the weekend, the Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (DAWN) Executive met with its Provincial Leaders at the DA National Campaign Headquarters, Nkululeko House, to deliberate on the key issues affecting women in South Africa. The ancillary structure of the DA has, among other things, reaffirmed their commitment to women empowerment through their newly launched “No Woman Left Behind” Campaign ahead of the 2019 general elections. Under the leadership of Dr Nomafrench Mbombo, DAWN has committed to prioritising the fight towards the eradication of the scourge of Gender-Based Violence which is deeply entrenched in South African society. DAWN has also committed to ensure that government departments, particularly the ineffective Department of Women in the Presidency, are held accountable for non-performance. The Department has time and again failed to perform its core mandate to advance the socio-economic empowerment of women and promote gender equality. The Network will soon be embarking on a national tour in order to reach ordinary women in South Africa, particularly the forgotten women in rural communities, whose plight often remain ignored by the ANC. The DA Women's Network has also pledged its commitment to advancing the project of non-racialism which is a cornerstone of the DA. DAWN will continue to fight for change and ensure that all South African women are empowered and have equal access to social, economic and political opportunities.
