David Makhura must act as sewage floods Emfuleni 27 June 2018 The DA calls on the Premier David Makhura to urgently intervene as effluent contaminates the Vaal River. News reports further reveal that residents in the Emfuleni Municipality have waste water flooding their back yards and their homes in some instances. The DA in Emfuleni has written to the Executive Mayor, Jacob Khawe, and the Municipal Manager, Oupa Nkone, demanding their immediate intervention into the sewage spills in Emfuleni. We understand however, that the municipality has been placed under administration and we therefore call on the Premier to ensure that urgent action is taken. This comes amid the lack of clarity around the intervention and of the terms of reference of the administrator. Service delivery in Emfuleni has come to a halt; refuse is not collected, sewage leakages are not attended to and there is no communication with residents regarding the 20% cut in water supply. There are areas in Emfuleni that are without water and this is a recurring problem. The DA demands answers regarding these chronic service delivery failings, as they pose a serious health risk to the people of Emfuleni. The people of Gauteng deserve and are ready for change that prioritises them and service delivery. Issued by Dady Mollo, DA Emfuleni Caucus Leader, 27 June 2018
