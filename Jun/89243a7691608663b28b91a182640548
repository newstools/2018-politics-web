KwaDukuza SAPS a no-show during a DA oversight inspection 19 June 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) will immediately alert Police Minister Bheki Cele about the incident this morning where the entire South African Police Service (SAPS) Station Management at KwaDukuza Police station failed to arrive at work today. This is despite advance notice to the station commander of an oversight inspection by myself and the Deputy Shadow Minister of Police Dianne Kohler-Barnard MP at the station this morning. The visit to this police station came after a public meeting with the residents of Stanger who complained about the spate of crime and drugs which has overtaken this community. It is unacceptable that senior SAPS management show such disdain for the right to oversight of Members of Parliament. The work of conducting oversight inspections ensures that needs of communities which we serve are addressed. We will request Minister Cele to institute an investigation against those members that refused to meet with the DA today. The DA will continue to fight for safer communities by holding SAPS accountable and ensure that we play our critical oversight role. KZN is in need of the kind of change under a DA-led government that places accountability and the safety of communities first. Issued by Dean Macpherson, DA KZN ILembe Constituency Head, 19 June 2018
