OUTA one step closer to declaring Dudu Myeni a delinquent director 27 June 2018 The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) is pleased with the outcome of the disciplinary hearing of suspended SAA executives Musa Zwane and Phumeza Nhantsi. The chairperson of the disciplinary hearing, Adv. Nazeer Cassim SC labelled Zwane and Nhantsi as “pliable, negligent, dishonest and willing to go with the charade” and recommended summary dismissal for both the directors. Zwane and Nhantsi were found guilty of charges relating to the BnP Capital deal which OUTA stopped in 2016. Zwane testified under oath that Myeni  questioned the decision why BnP Capital could not be paid and pressurised him to pay BnP Capital a cancellation fee of R49.9million. “The outcome of this case takes us one step closer to seeing former chairperson of the SAA board, Dudu Myeni, held to account for her role in the demise of SAA.” said Rudie Heyneke OUTA’s Portfolio Manager on Transport. It is clear that Myeni showed little regard for the financial state of the national carrier and was determined to pay BnP Capital. “OUTA instituted legal action in 2017 to have Ms Myeni declared a delinquent director for, among other things, her persistence in forging ahead with the BnP Capital deal,” added Heyneke. In addition to the case against Myeni, OUTA laid criminal charges against Daniel Mahlangu,  the director of BnP Capital and a complaint against Nhantsi is currently with the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors(IRBA).
