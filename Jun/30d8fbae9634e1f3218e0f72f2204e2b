ANC-led Emfuleni washes away R121 million worth of the people’s money 20 June 2018 The DA is shocked to learn that the Emfuleni Local Municipality has lost water to the value of R121 934 382,76 for the period of 1 July 2017 to 31 December 2017. This was revealed to me by the Gauteng COGTA MEC, Uhuru Moiloa, in a written reply to my questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. According to the MEC this water has either been stolen or unaccounted for. This water wastage by this municipality is unacceptable as water is a scarce natural resource that needs to be preserved. These water losses could have been avoided by fixing water leakages, monitoring water pipes and as well as urging residents to report burst water pipes. These millions lost as a result of water loss could have been used to pay the debt that the municipality owes to Rand Water. This indicates that the municipality does not have an effective monitoring system in place to curb water loses. The DA calls on the COGTA MEC, Uhuru Moiloa to intervene as a matter of urgency to ensure that stringent measures are put in place to reduce water loses in Emfuleni. We will be tabling further questions in the Gauteng Legislature to ascertain exactly what caused the water losses in Emfuleni. It is clear that the ANC does not have the capacity to deliver quality services to the people of Emfuleni and Gauteng. The people of Emfuleni deserves the kind of change that only a DA-led government can deliver, where the people come first and their money is used to build a working community for all.
