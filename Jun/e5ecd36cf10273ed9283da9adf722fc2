UCT notes inappropriate phrasing in winter school programme 21 June 2018 The University of Cape Town has noted the inclusion of the words “POC” in the programme of the Decolonised Winter School (DWS), scheduled for 24-30 June [see below - PW]. The words are understood to be an abbreviated version of “people of colour”. Entrance to UCT events may not be restricted on the basis of race. Our understanding is that the students and alumni arranging the event have been informed accordingly and have agreed that the programme wording will be changed.
