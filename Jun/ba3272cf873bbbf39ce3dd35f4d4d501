Areas of concern with IEC Commissioner candidate short-list 25 June 2018 On the 8th of June 2018 we published a comprehensive report on the 26 short-listed candidates for the IEC Commissioner positions. While undertaking the research for the report, several concerns were highlighted that should not be overlooked. We have categorised the concerns in a short report and they range from allegations of mismanagement, political affiliations, violations of constitutional obligations and other controversies. As these candidates are vying to take up positions at the Electoral Commission, it would be expected that the successful candidates have a track record of being free, fair and impartial in their former employment and business ventures. As a Chapter 9 institution with a critical responsibility in our democracy, it is imperative that the Electoral Commission’s integrity and reputation remains intact. The three individuals who will be appointed to the Electoral Commission therefore need to be above reproach. This is even more important in a political environment that is due to become even more challenged and contested over the coming year. In addition, because of the upcoming general election next year, the Electoral Commission will be scrutinised even more closely than usual. We should therefore guard against appointing new Commissioners whose track record, affiliations and reputations could be used to discredit the IEC.
