Greater regulation needed in Cash Transport Services 12 June 2018 The recent spike in the number of cash-in-transit heists has resulted in the decision by members of the Motors Transport Workers Union (MTWU) to march against the brutal murder of security guards in the cash motor transport industry The Democratic Alliance stands in solidarity with the innocent victims and their families, who are just trying to earn an income for their loved ones. Gauteng has experienced a concerning rise in Cash in Transit totaling 159 robberies over the past six months. The same period in 2017 saw 147 robberies. We support the call for improved training, and quality protective equipment for guards and the security reinforcement of vehicles. The Gauteng Legislature hosted a Community Safety Portfolio Committee meeting on the 8th of June, where the issue of cash in transit heists was on the agenda. A concerned public crowd filled the room to hear about the plan on curbing the rise in cash in transits. To my disappointment, there was no detailed plan of curbing and preventing such attacks, instead promises that SAPS knows who the culprits are and that more action will be forthcoming in the next few months. The Committee was informed that R95 million has been recovered, and 16 vehicles used in the robberies have been compounded. However, the risk posed to security guards and by standers remains. The Democratic Alliance will continue exerting pressure on the provincial government to introduce a regulatory body for the industry. One that will ensure that the workers are sufficiently trained, protected, and that the families of the murdered workers are looked after. The DA is the only party which can bring the kind of change that ensures safety and order in our communities. A vote a DA-led government is a vote for a crime-free society.
