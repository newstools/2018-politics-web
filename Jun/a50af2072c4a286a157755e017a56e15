MEDIA REPORTS REGARDING THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL The Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) Mr Senzeni Zokwana, MP notes with serious concern recent media reports concerning the Director General, Mr Mike Mlengana. Contrary to the sensational headlines, Minister Zokwana has not placed the Director General under suspension. Recent High Court Judgements have confirmed that the power to suspend or initiate disciplinary proceedings is vested to the President according to Section 12(1) (a) of the Public Service Act. Minister Zokwana has referred all matters pertaining to the conduct of the Director General to the President as contained in the public service policies and regulatory prescripts. Minister Zokwana, will therefore not engage the media on internal disciplinary matters. Statement issued by Khaye Nkwanyana, Spokesperson Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 21 June 2018
