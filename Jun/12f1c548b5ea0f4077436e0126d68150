DA reiterates call for return of specialized anti-crime units as KZN comes under siege The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal today reiterates its call for the urgent reinstatement of specialized anti-crime units, in particular the anti-hijacking unit, as the province comes under siege. The move follows two separate incidents this week. On Monday 9 year old Sadia Sukhraj was killed in a botched hijacking while yesterday, a Durban father was killed in front of his two children during yet another attempted hijacking. The DA extends its sincere condolences to the Sukhraj and Chetty families and to the many families who have lost loved ones due to this and other senseless and violent crime. Our province is under attack and something has to be done. According to the national Crime Statistics, KwaZulu-Natal was second only to Gauteng in 2017 when it comes to vehicle theft and car hijackings, with 3 029 hijackings reported. The DA has been calling for the re-introduction of the once excellent anti-hijacking unit ever since it was first disbanded. This unit had an strong track record in cracking the syndicates behind hijacking. The question is – what are SAPS waiting for? The DA expects both KZN Community Safety MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda and Acting KZN Police Commissioner General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi to call on National Police Minister Bheki Cele and National SAPS Commissioner General Khehla Sitole and to fight for the reestablishment of this and other successful anti-crime units in the province, including the anti-narcotics unit and the taxi violence unit. It is unacceptable that the people of KwaZulu-Natal should have to live in fear each and every day.
