DA condemns horrific attack in Malmesbury 14 June 2018 We are shocked and deeply saddened to hear the heart breaking news of the Mosque attack in Malmesbury this morning. Our deepest sympathies and condolences go out to the whole Muslim community after this brutal and senseless crime. It breaks my heart that one person can destroy so many lives. We hold the families of the victims in our thoughts and prayers. The South African constitution states that people have the right to religious freedom which includes the freedom to worship. An attack on people while they worship is a direct attack on the constitution and the freedoms we enjoy in this country. We commend the local South African Police Service (SAPS) for their quick response to the incident. DA Constituency Head Anton Bredell was on the scene this morning to provide additional support to bereaved residents. We condemn this attack in the strongest terms and will continue to support the community of Malmesbury in their time of grief.
