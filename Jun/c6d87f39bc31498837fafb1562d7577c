DA welcomes Esidimeni pay-out 13 June 2018 According to the Office of the Premier, all payments were made by today, ahead of 19th June 2018 deadline set by Justice Moseneke. It appears that the money was found from the budgets of all the provincial government departments. I am pleased that the provincial government has met this commitment which provides financial redress to the relatives of those who suffered and died in the Esidimeni tragedy. Justice Moseneke’s ruling was that R1 million be paid to each claimant for constitutional damages, R 180 000 for emotional trauma, and R 20 000 funeral expenses for those who died. More money will still be paid as the relatives of the 1418 patients who survived can also make financial claims as provided for by Justice Moseneke for those who were not part of the arbitration.
