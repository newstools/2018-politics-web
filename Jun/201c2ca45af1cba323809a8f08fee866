Mashaba does not run Johannesburg alone 12 June 2018 The ACDP notes with regret the proposed suspension of the MMC for health for her comments on Israel. The ACDP respects the right of the DA to discipline a member for violation of their own policy. However, the ACDP wishes to remind Mayor Mashaba that Johannesburg City policy is not DA policy. The coalition partners have never discussed the city position on Israel much less agreed on the Mayor's position. Until such time as all parties have discussed and agreed on a position there is no City Policy towards Israel. The ACDP also wishes to remind Mayor Mashaba that an MMC cannot be suspended by him alone but must have the support of council. The ACDP will not support this suspension. The ACDP points out that the DA is bound to discuss issues with its coalition partners before making announcements in council. Issued by Keeno Petersen, Media Liaison Officer, ACDP, 12 June 2018
