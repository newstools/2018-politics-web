President and Ministerâ€™s silence on farm murders unacceptable 25 June 2018 The FF Plus was shocked to learn of the wave of farm murders this past weekend and is disappointed that the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, and President Cyril Ramaphosa are silent on the matter. Pres Ramaphosa was quick to offer his condolences when mosques were attacked, and people were killed and he even appointed a presidential commission of inquiry to investigate these attacks and murders in mosques. But he is silent when it comes to farm murders. The same is true for the Minister of Police who also condemned the attacks and murders in mosques, but who said nothing about the farm murders. The three men who were murdered at the weekend are: Mr Jeffrey Zetler (62) of the farm Mooiberge outside Stellenbosch, Mr Kallie Schoonraad (47) from Rustenburg and Mr Peter Dawson (64) from Hartbeespoort. Not too long ago, the Minister of Police said that robberies at residential premises are part of the trio crimes that are a priority for the police. The FF Plus believes that a farm attack, as well as a farm murder, fall in the same category as robberies at homes in towns or cities and should, therefore, also be a priority for the police. The leader of the FF Plus, Dr Pieter Groenewald, will address a letter to Pres Ramaphosa and will request that a commission of inquiry must be appointed for farm murders. He will furthermore request an urgent meeting with the Minister of Police to ask him to treat farm murders as a priority. The FF Plus offers its condolences to the families of the murdered farmers and the party will continue to fight to make the government realise that it is of the utmost importance that farm murders must be effectively combated.
