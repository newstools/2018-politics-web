Gauteng Government not adequately funding NPOs 19 June 2018 It is concerning that out of the R2 774 257 000 allocated for funding of NPOs, as of 18 May 2018, only R157 834 042 has been paid over to NPOs. This is according to a written reply by the MEC for Social Development, Nandi Mayathula-Khoza to questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. According to the MEC, there was a delay in the approval of the budget to be transferred to NPOs. The budget was submitted in March 2018 but was only approved in April 2018. The delays in payment of NPOs has impacted negatively on their day-to-day operations as they solely depend on it for sustainability. The DA fully agrees with the need for all NPOs to be registered and as such, is calling on the department to assist NPOs with the required documentation in order for them to be compliant, especially those who have had difficulty updating their NPO certificates and registering on the Central Supplier Database. Where NPOs have different names on their compliance certificates and bank accounts, we urge them to rectify this as a matter of urgency, so that they can sign the Service Level Agreement with the department. I will continue to monitor this situation closely as our poor people who rely on the services offered by these NPOs cannot be held to ransom by the department’s chronic mismanagement.
