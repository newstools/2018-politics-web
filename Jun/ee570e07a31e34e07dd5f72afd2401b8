Hlaudi plays cat and mouse with the courts – Solidarity Trade union Solidarity today confirmed that it received an application from Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s legal team in terms of which the former SABC chief operations officer is applying to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal. This comes after the Supreme Court of Appeal on 5 June had dismissed Motsoeneng’s previous application for leave to appeal with costs. According to Anton van der Bijl, head of Solidarity’s Labour Law division, Motsoeneng is simply postponing the inevitable. “He is playing a cat and mouse game with the courts, but he will back himself into a corner yet again,” Van der Bijl said. According to Van der Bijl, Motsoeneng has been resorting to one court after the other to oppose the ruling of 8 September in terms of which Motsoeneng and Simon Tebele are personally liable for the legal costs the SABC 8 had incurred, and each time the outcome was the same. Van der Bijl furthermore says that the trade union has already given instruction to oppose Motsoeneng’s latest application. “Solidarity has repeatedly indicated that it will not rest until Motsoeneng has paid the costs in his personal capacity as the court had ordered. We are looking forward to oppose him in the highest court in the country,” Van der Bijl said. Statement issued by Anton van der Bijl, Solidarity: Head of Labour Law Services, 22 June 2018
