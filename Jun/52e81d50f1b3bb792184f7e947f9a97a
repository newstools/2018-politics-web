Psychiatric patients injured at Bheki Mlangeni Hospital 21 June 2018 Seven mental health patients have been injured and four staff members assaulted at the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital in Soweto since January last year as a result of inadequate facilities for psychiatric patients. This is revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. According to Ramokgopa, the hospital does not have a dedicated psychiatric ward, and admitted 2428 mental health patients from March last year to March this year who were placed in ordinary wards. Last year she said that two 6-bed cubicles had been identified to accommodate psychiatric patients, but this has not happened despite the need for a secure facility to prevent injuries or assaults. Bheki Mlangenl is a District hospital and is legally obliged to accommodate psychiatric patients for 72 hours observation. I am concerned that a large number of psychiatric patients are referred to this hospital without adequate measures to ensure that they cannot harm themselves or others. A dedicated psychiatric ward at this hospital should be set up as soon as possible. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 21 June 2018
