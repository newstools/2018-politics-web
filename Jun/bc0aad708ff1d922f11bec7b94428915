NUMSA will consult members on Eskom's latest offer 28 June 2018 The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) has received a final revised offer from Eskom. The breakdown is as follows: - 6.2 increase for 2018 - 6% for the second year - 6% for the third year If CPI is greater the increase will be based on inflation but it won’t be less than 6%. The comprehensive offer which all unions had made to Eskom was: - 9% wage increase for 2018 - 8.6% increase for the second year and - 8.5% increase for 2020. It is shocking that Eskom has not dealt decisively with the demand from unions to cancel the IPP project because of the dire cost implications for the power utility. Eskom management admitted that the IPP project was responsible for the financial crisis it is in, but they want unions to endorse it anyway. They have also not dealt with the demand to reduce the bloated top management structure of over 400 executives who earn pay packages of a million rand or more; and for them to deal decisively with high coal costs. These are the things which have brought Eskom to the brink of financial ruin. We have decided to take this offer back to our members for them to reflect on. They must tell us how they feel about it and give us a mandate for the way forward. We will meet again next Friday where we will communicate the decision of our members. Aluta continua! The struggle continues! Issued by Irvin Jim, NUMSA General Secretary, 28 June 2018
