VBS Bank: MEC Creecy unfazed by collapse of Merafong and West Rand District Gauteng Finance MEC, Barbara Creecy, cannot tell the residents of Merafong and the West Rand District (WRD) municipality if the illegal investments made with VBS bank will be recovered. MEC Creecy was tight-lipped about how these municipalities will fund their budgets without this much-needed capital, simply stating that provincial Treasury will assist. The details of this assistance was not forthcoming. The MEC’s lacklustre response further underscores the DA’s contention that internal ANC politics is interfering with her position in government and has rendered her a Constitutional delinquent. It is her responsibility to implement Section 139 of the Constitution and place municipalities such as Merafong and the WRD under administration so that residents are not denied services. Today, we again implored the MEC to take the steps stipulated in Section 139 to no avail. The MEC indicated that there will be a forensic investigation has been initiated on the request of the two respective Mayors. However, given this ANC-led provincial government's lack of appetite to convict people found guilty in forensic investigations, it is likely that this process will bear no tangible outcome for the affected residents. We will continue to ensure that this gross mismanagement of the people’s money is not swept under the carpet like many other "investigations” initiated by the ANC.
