DA calls on MEC Lesufi to investigate claims of xenophobia and racism at Boksburg School 18 June 2018 I have written to the MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi asking him to investigate claims of xenophobia and racism at Freeway Park Primary School in Boksburg. In a sound clip, sent to me, the principal of the school can be heard speaking to a teacher who is originally from Zimbabwe in a condescending and belittling manner. There have however, also been allegations of racism and xenophobia. The principal can also be heard asking the teacher if she has a SACE number and if she has all her paperwork in order, that would allow her to work in the country. It has been alleged that the principal humiliated the teacher, who eventually broke down in tears and collapsed. The DA believes that all foreign nationals who enter the country, should do so legally and have all the necessary documentation that would allow them to work in the country. We cannot tolerate any kind of xenophobia or racism in our schools, particularly from principals who need to set the example to both teachers and learners on how they should behave towards their fellow colleagues and learners. Schools are intended to be places of safety for staff and pupils alike. I will be monitoring the progress of this investigation closely.
