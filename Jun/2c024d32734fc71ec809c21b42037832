Nearly R3 billion worth of water wasted in Gauteng 21 June 2018 Today the FF Plus was shocked to learn that nearly R3 billion worth of water was wasted by municipalities in Gauteng during the 2016/17 financial year. The information was gleaned from the response of the MEC for Local Governance, Mr Uhuru Moila, to a written question by the FF Plus MPL in Gauteng, Mr Philip van Staden, about what water wastage in the province cost the tax payer over the said period. The water wastage by municipalities in Gauteng is mainly caused by theft and the damage of infrastructure, water leakages, burst pipes, leaking reservoirs, blocked sewage systems, poor maintenance and old infrastructure. All the municipalities in Gauteng have wasted a lot of water and there is no distinction to be made between guilty and innocent parties. The water wasted by each municipality is as follows: Johannesburg Metro (Alexandra, Diepkloof, Diepsloot, Ennerdale, Johannesburg, Johannesburg South, Lawley, Lenasia, Lenasia South, Meadowlands East, Meadowlands West, Midrand, Orange Farm, Pimville, Randburg, Roodepoort, Sandton, Soweto): R1,093,400,000.00 Tshwane Metro (Akasia, Atteridgeville, Bronkhorstspruit, Centurion, Cullinan, Ekangala, Ga-Rankuwa, Garsfontein, Hammanskraal, Irene, Kudube, Mabopane, Mamelodi, Pretoria, Pretoria North, Rayton, Refilwe, Roodeplaat, Soshanguve, Temba, Winterveldt): R503,045,899.00 Ekurhuleni City (Alberton, Bedfordview, Benoni, Birchleigh, Boksburg, Brakpan, Clayville, Daveyton, Dunnottar, Edenvale, Geduld, Germiston, Katlehong, Kempton Park, Kwa-Thema, Machenzieville, Nigel, Olifantsfontein, Springs, Tembisa, Tokoza, Vosloorus, Vorsterkroon): R787,774,009.00 Emfuleni (Evaton, Sebokeng, Vaal Oewer, Vanderbijlpark, Vereeniging): R220,549,675.00 Mogale City (Krugersdorp, Magaliesburg, Muldersdrift): R87,736,629.42 Rand West (Randfontein, Westonaria): R51,854,325.00 Lesedi (Devon, Heidelberg, Nigel, Vischkuil): R1,544,106.00 Merafong City (Carletonville, Fochville, Wedela): R42,485,098.00 Midvaal (De Deur/Walkerville, Eikenhof, Meyerton, Vaal Marina): R26,224,438.00 Total amount: R2,814,614,179.42 The FF Plus is worried about the extent of water wastage in Gauteng and is of the opinion that municipalities need urgent interventions to prevent Gauteng from suffering water shortages in the future due to the wastage. The Gauteng government must put more pressure on the municipalities to ensure that the needless water wastage is brought to an end and that infrastructure is improved and better maintained.
