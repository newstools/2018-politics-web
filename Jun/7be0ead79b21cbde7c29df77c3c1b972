AfriForum submits memorandum and petition against expropriation to Parliament 12 June 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum submitted a memorandum and petition at Parliament today in which objections are raised against the proposed process of expropriation without compensation. A petition that was signed by nearly 250 000 concerned members of the public, in which objections against expropriation without compensation are raised, was also submitted to Parliament. Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum, says that the government’s resolution to make expropriation without compensation possible is based on a crooked image of the past, a deceptive land audit and a distorted concept of basic economic principles. The memorandum contains a summary of AfriForum’s biggest objections against the proposed process to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to empower the state to expropriate property without compensation. A report, wherein the reality of land ownership in South Africa is set out, was submitted along with the memorandum. The purpose hereof is to show to Parliament that the decision made earlier this year regarding expropriation without compensation is based on a deceptive state audit. Roets explains that although AfriForum raised objections against amending the Constitution and reserves its rights to oppose the process in court, the organisation believes that it is important to lay the facts regarding expropriation without compensation – and the potential destructive results thereof – on the table. AfriForum will also write to Parliament with the aim of making oral presentations to Parliament regarding this issue. Issued by Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO, AfriForum, 12 June 2018
