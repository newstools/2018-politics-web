ANC ruining South Africa’s economy and exacerbating poverty 5 June 2018 The shocking decline of 2,2% in South Africa’s economic growth rate is indicative of the disastrous consequences of ANC policy. Voters must now get rid of the ruling party to prevent the country from falling off the economic edge as a failed state. Statistics just released by Stats SA (SSA) on the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) make it clear that President Cyril Ramaphosa has had no effect on the country’s economy. On the contrary, South Africa is worse off in his first term than in the last term under President Jacob Zuma (last term 2017), when the GDP grew with 3,1%. It was expected that the agricultural sector would help to improve the economic figures, but there is no real support for this sector and the sharp decline of 24,7% in the agricultural sector should make it clear to the government that urgent decisive action is needed to save the sector. The economic contraction is no doubt related to the uncertainty caused by numerous policies, like Black Economic Empowerment in general. In the mining sector, contributing factors like uncertainty about the Mining Charter causes unnecessary disruption, while expropriation without compensation may bring about damaging consequences for the agricultural sector in particular. The only solution to this problem is that voters must realise that the ANC failed them and that a reasonable coalition government, in which the FF Plus is the only party that protects the free market, must be formed to oust the ANC in the 2019 elections.
