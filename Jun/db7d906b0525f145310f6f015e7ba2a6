ANC statement on social media insults directed at the President of the ANC 5 June 2018 The African National Congress condemns in the strongest terms insults directed at the person of the President, Cde Cyril Ramaphosa, by ANC leaders as well as members on social media. The African National Congress National Executive Committee recently adopted a social media policy that moves from a premise that all ANC structures and members will operate within the discipline and policies of the organisation whilst still expressly enjoying freedom of expression. The ANC believes that it is possible to express viewpoints without resorting to personal attacks and insults. The African National Congress social media policy’s (Rule 36) prescribes that any social media posting must be legal, ethical and respectful at all times while (Rule 40) prohibits members from utilising inflammatory language. We therefore find the recent upsurge in insults towards ourleadership, particularly the President, extremely disturbing and view them in serious light. The use of social media platforms should at all times be in line with the ANC Constitution and Code of Conduct and seek to advance debates and discussions in a rational and responsible manner. To this end, we have impressed upon the Gauteng and Free State Provincial Executive Committees to institute disciplinary processes against the instigators of disunitywithin the organisation, without delay. This is specifically with reference to the Mayor of Dihlabeng Local Municipality who publicly insulted President Ramaphosa.
