Farm attacks increase by 34% 27 June 2018 Although there are only three days left before the end of June, there have been – in comparison with the first six months of 2017 – a 34% increase in farm attacks during the first six months of 2018 already. According to AfriForum’s records, 33 farm murders could be verified since the start of the year. AfriForum particularly expressed its concern over the brutal murders of Gabriel (78) and Marian Bruwer (67) and once again urged the government and the South African Police Service (SAPS) to prioritise farm murders. The bodies of the Bruwers were found yesterday in their farmhouse at Vanstadensrus. They were bound to chairs. A pillow was used as a silencer before both Gabriel and Marian were shot in the head. They were members of AfriForum. During the first six months of 2017, 157 farm attacks took place and 40 farm murders were committed. Since the start of January 2018, 210 farm attacks occurred and 33 farm murders were committed. Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum and the author of the book Kill the Boer (which will be launched in this week), says that farm murders take place at an unusual frequency and that are unusually cruel. “The widely spread allegation, that farm murders are currently at its lowest point ever, is plain false. To be honest, our verified data shows that farm murders have been increasing since 2011. Although less farm murders were committed in the first six months of 2018 than in the first six months of 2017, we are gravely concerned about the sharp increase in farm attacks,” says Roets. Roets adds that AfriForum will intensify its campaign against farm murders in the coming months. In the meantime, AfriForum urges the farming community to be more vigilant regarding their own safety and to join community safety networks.
