DA welcomes ConCourt ruling lifting 20 year limit to report sexual offences 14 June 2018 The DA welcomes the Constitutional Court ruling today to uphold a High Court ruling lifting the time limit of reporting sexual offences. The ruling comes after eight women, who accused Sidney Frankel of sexually abusing them as children, approached the Court to reverse a law which prevented victims of sexual abuse from laying criminal charges more than 20 years after the abuse. This ruling is a victory for South Africans, girls and boys, men and women alike, who have been victims of sexual abuse and have suffered in silence for years. The DA trusts that this ruling will provide hope for other victims of sexual abuse and empower them to come forward and find justice.
