NUM is angered by claims that an average employee at Eskom earns 789, 000. 14 June 2018 The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is deeply angered and concerned by claims that the average employee at Eskom earns R789‚000 per year. Our members do not earn that kind of money. Economist Mike Schüssler tweeted on Tuesday the average employee at the power utility earned R789‚000. This a lie. It is a serious insult to our members who are currently being offered a 0% by Eskom. Apartheid wage gap still exists at Eskom and black women are some of the lowest paid at Eskom.
