President Ramaphosa appoints advisory panel on Land Reform 21 September 2018 Pretoria - President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed an advisory panel on land reform that will support the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Land Reform chaired by Deputy President David Mabuza. The panel will advise the IMC on a broad range of policy matters associated with land reform, including restitution, redistribution, tenure security and agricultural support. The panel comprises 10 members who are eminently qualified by virtue of academic background, professional experience, social entrepreneurship or activism related to the agricultural economy and land policy. The panel embodies a diversity of experience and perspectives that will enrich the IMC’s deliberations on land reform as an enabler for a united, cohesive society and an inclusive, efficient and globally competitive economy. The panel is chaired by social entrepreneur and public policy and development planning specialist Dr Vuyokazi (Vuyo) Mahlati, who is serving her second term as a member of the National Planning Commission. Dr Mahlati, who serves in various public capacities, is President of the African Farmers Association of South Africa. The panel is expected to provide perspectives on land policy in the context of persisting land inequality, unsatisfactory land and agrarian reform and uneven urban land development. The panel is mandated to review, research and suggest models for government to implement a fair and equitable land reform process that redresses the injustices of the past, increases agricultural output, promotes economic growth and protects food security. During a brief introductory meeting with the panel in Pretoria on Tuesday, 18 September 2018, President Ramaphosa and Deputy President Mabuza invited the panel to provide the IMC with critical and independent inputs that will facilitate sound policy making and effective implementation. Dr Mahlati will convene the following panelists: - Professor Ruth Hall, a researcher and professor at the University of the Western Cape’s Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies. Her research work in South Africa and the continent spans over 23 years and has played an integral role in shaping discourse on South African land reform beginning with the constitutional negotiations. Her key research interests and focus have been on land redistribution, restitution claims and farm workers. - Professor Mohammed Karaan, Professor in Agricultural Economics at Stellenbosch University. He has extensive experience in agricultural sciences and agricultural economics working in both the academic and corporate environments.
