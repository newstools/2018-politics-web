COSATU demands answers and accountability over the Denel Munitions explosion 4 September 2018 The Congress of South African Trade Unions mourns the death of eight metalworkers at the Rheinmetall Denel Munitions (RDM) site in Somerset West. We send our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased workers and wish all the injured workers a speedy recovery. The federation is demanding a thorough and comprehensive investigation to establish the cause of this terrible accident. The number of workers who are dying at work due to fatal accidents in this country is totally unacceptable. What is disconcerting is that while workers are continuing to die every day; there is not a single person who has been prosecuted or held accountable. This cavalier and indifferent approach by the relevant authorities about the issues surrounding the safety of workers is deeply troubling. This level if inaction by the relevant departmentsÂ suggests that they are not worried about the safety of the workers. The federation is demanding action against these deteriorating safety standards in workplaces all across the country. We shall continue to work with our affiliated trade unions to demand better safety working conditions for workers. We demand solid answers about this explosion and if anyone is found to have been reckless, there has to be consequences. Issued by Sizwe Pamla, National Spokesperson, COSATU, 4 September 2018
