DA to seek information about safety standards of all government buildings 13 September 2018 The DA, through my colleague in the National Assembly, Malcolm Figg MP, will submit a raft of Parliamentary Questions to get detailed information of the status of the safety standards of all government department buildings. This follows reports that workers at the Department of Health in Tshwane have downed tools citing safety concerns over the building they work in. Further to this, on Tuesday, Tshwane Mayor, Solly Msimanga, inspected and evacuated the Poyntons Building, which houses the Department of Correctional Services and personnel from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), due to its non-compliance with a plethora of health and safety laws and regulations. Civil servants should not fear for their safety in their workplace and should work in buildings which comply with the health and safety requirements. The reports today come on the back of a devasting fire last week in which 3 firefights needlessly lost their lives while trying to put out the blaze at the Gauteng Provincial Government’s Lisbon building in Johannesburg, which was only 21% complaint with safety and health regulations. This loss of life was tragic and unnecessary. It is unacceptable that government employees are subjected to unsafe buildings which do not meet the required compliance with health and safety regulations. It points to how hard-working employees are disregarded by the failing ANC government. The DA will ensure that, through Parliamentary questions, we will get a full picture of the state of all government buildings in the hope that needless loss of life is prevented and those responsible for not complying, are made to account.
