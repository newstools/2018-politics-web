City of Tshwane resolves to institute probe tender irregularity allegations 11 September 2018 The City of Tshwane has resolved to institute an investigation into allegations of tender irregularities in the City. Spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said the council also elected to withdraw some of the authority delegated to City manager Moeketsi Mosola and to empower the chief operating officer (COO) to appoint an independent investigator. "While this is not ideal, the executive will exercise maximum oversight of the investigative process to ensure that the integrity of the investigation is safeguarded and all the facts that culminated in the conclusion of this transaction are established, and any wrongdoing is expeditiously dealt with," Mgobozi said. In August, the City found itself in hot water after allegations of tender irregularities, following a reported R12bn deal with a company to oversee project management in the capital city. The council later suspendedÂ Mosola. At the time, Mosola denied the allegations and said all processes were above board and in line with the Municipal Finance Management Act. Mgobozi said, where there were allegations of wrongdoing, the City would always ensure that they were investigated to ensure that the rights of all were upheld and that appropriate action was taken where needed. He said during the investigation, the City put measures in place to ensure that the continuity of service delivery to communities was not compromised. "This investigation will not halt the momentum this government has gained in terms of turning the City around. Rather we will continue to deliver more and better services to all residents," he said.
