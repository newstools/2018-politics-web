EFF STATEMENT ON HERITAGE DAY Monday, 24 September, 2018 The EFF joins all South Africans in celebrating Heritage Day. On this day, we reiterate our call for the return of the land through the amendment of our constitution to allow expropriation without compensation. The most important heritage upon which all culture is based, is the land. We further call on the government to remove Die Stem from our National Anthem. Including the removal of all apartheid and colonial statues and symbols. These symbols perpetuate the comfort of racists and white supremacy. Finally, we call on the entire continent to embrace Kiswahili as a language of continental unity. Let us take pride in our heritage. Statement issued by Economic Freedom Fighters, 24 September 2018
