SAHRC to conduct hospital inspection after Klebsiella pneumonia outbreak 19 September 2018 The SA Human Rights Commission is expected to conduct a site inspection at Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus, Johannesburg on Wednesday. This, after six newborn babies died following a Klebsiella pneumonia outbreak at the hospital. "Further allegations indicate that overcrowding at the hospital's neonatal unit played a key role in the outbreak and spreading of the bacteria," the commission's provincial manager Buang Jones said. Jones said the commission found that the outbreak constituted a prima facie violation of the right to access to health care. "In light of this, the commission will conduct the inspection in order to assess the state of the hospital in relation to the allegations and will also meet with acting CEO Dr Jatin Ganda and the management of the hospital on this date," he said. On Tuesday, News24 reported that a National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) report found that control measures were compromised by overcrowding. The NICD also found that 90 newborn babies were placed in a ward which had a capacity of 61. News24
