Scuffle in Nelson Mandela Bay council after 'new' councillor's presence ruled illegal 25 September 2018 A scuffle broke out in the Nelson Mandela Bay council on Tuesday after Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya ruled there was an illegal councillor in the chamber. 'New' DA councillor Lutho Sokudela was sworn in last month after the now infamous council meeting that saw former mayor Athol Trollip ousted, and Mbulelo Manyati "removed" by the DA. However, the Eastern Cape High Court ruled last week that Manyati was still a councillor until he chose to resign, or disciplinary measures against him were concluded by the DA. The city manager read out the court judgment to clarify the matter. Sokudela was therefore "illegally" in council, Mafaya told the chamber. News24 understands that the scuffle ensued after metro police attempted to remove Sokudela. More to follow. News24
