Strike at Germiston mortuary causes bodies to pile up 13 September 2018 I am concerned by the strike at the Germiston state mortuary which is hurting grieving relatives who can’t get the bodies of their loved ones for burial. Forensic staff are apparently striking because of a lack of protective gear. The Gauteng Health Department is responsible for this mortuary and should have addressed staff grievances which have caused previous strikes. But this is an illegal strike because mortuaries are an essential service, and families are suffering as the bodies pile up. The Democratic Alliances calls for responsible behaviour on all sides so that post-mortems can be speedily performed and bodies released as soon as possible.
