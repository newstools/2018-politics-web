Sasol statement on Solidarity 3 September 2018 Sasol has received notification from the trade union Solidarity of its intent to strike today. In this respect, we have activated contingency measures to minimise potential disruption to our operations. Currently, parts of our Secunda and Sasolburg Operations are busy with planned maintenance shutdowns and activities in this respect continue as scheduled. Planning for these shutdowns is an ongoing annual process. Our operations that are not part of the annual maintenance shutdown are also continuing as planned. We continue to monitor the situation. Our priority is ensuring that all personnel are engaged to ensure safe and ongoing operations. Sasol remains committed to open and honest engagement with all our trade union partners and our employees. Issued by Alex Anderson,Â Head of Group Media Relations, Sasol Limited, 3 September 2018
