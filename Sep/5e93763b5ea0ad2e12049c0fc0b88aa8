#StateCaptureInquiry: Zondo denies Guptas' requests for cross-examination in scathing ruling 13 September 2018 The chairperson of the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has denied the Gupta brothers leave to cross-examine witnesses. Ajay and Rajesh Gupta had applied to cross examineÂ former deputy minister Mcebisi Jonas, former GCIS head Themba Maseko and former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor. He said the Guptas had no valid reason not to appear before the commission, and denied their request for the commission to travel abroad to hear their testimony. He also denied their request to testify via videolink. "If the commission does not hear the side of the Gupta brothers it will not be because of the commission but that they decided to turn their backs on South Africa," Zondo said. He added that the commission does not see any reason to give the Gupta brothers any special treatment and will not do so. Zondo said he would consider the Gupta brothers' request if they were willing to return to the country. Zuma granted request Zondo, however, granted former President Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane Zuma leave to cross examine Jonas. Zondo handed down his ruling on Thursday in Parktown, Johannesburg. Previously, Zondo expressed concern over the Gupta brothers' applications to cross-examine witnesses, while not being present in South Africa themselves. He raised this issue again on Thursday while handing down his ruling. This, after advocate Mike Hellens, SC, for Ajay Gupta, said his client was willing to testify and wanted to cross-examine witnesses from a location outside of the country. Hellens said the commission doesn't have to send a "caravan" to Dubai, one representative could go. Worried about being arrested He claimed the Gupta brothers were worried about possibly being arrested if they returned to South Africa, labeling the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) as "recklessly incompetent and a national embarrassment". Hellens also told the commission that Ajay Gupta has a "powerfully contrary version" to Mentor's version of events, that might not be put before the commission. Mentor told the commission that Ajay Gupta had offered her the job of public enterprises minister if she in turn would drop the SAA Johannesburg to Mumbai route so that a Gupta-linked company, Jet Airways, could benefit. She said Ajay told her that there was a planned reshuffle by Zuma and he was going to fire Barbara Hogan, who was the incumbent. Former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas also claimed the Guptas offered him R600m if he accepted the finance minister post. Jacob Zuma has not applied to question any of the witnesses at the hearing. News24
