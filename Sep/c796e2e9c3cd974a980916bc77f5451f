KZN premier releases Moerane Commission report into political killings 20 September 2018 KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu has released the 423-page Moerane Commission report, looking into political killings in the province. Mchunu tabled the report before the KwaZulu-Natal legislature in Pietermaritzburg on Thursday, following a lengthy process of witness testimonies and evidence gathering. In his executive summary, the premier said the commission had found "serious weaknesses in the criminal justice system", as well as national intelligence and other security apparatus, that affected the effectiveness of personnel, coordination and coherence among security entities. "This obviously hampers the prevention and resolving of cases related to political murders," he said. "The recruitment of criminal elements by politicians to achieve political ends, resulting in a complex matrix of criminal and political associations, inevitably contributes to political murders."
