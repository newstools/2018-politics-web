Free State by-election: People of Nala reject ANC, vote for change 6 September 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State is elated at the results of yesterday’s by-elections, especially in Nala, Free State where we have won Ward 2 off the ANC. In growing numbers voters are coming out to reject the failing ANC, voting against their brand of corruption, racial division and poor a lack of service delivery. The people of Ward 2 Nala have voted in favour of the delivery of quality services, a caring party and the DA’s brand of change that always puts the people first. The win in Nala saw the DA grow by 20%, representing a big swing toward the DA, and a further decline for the ANC. The result in Nala, and in all by-elections yesterday, bodes well for the DA’s build up to Election 2019. Voters continue to reject the ANC, and place their trust in the DA. While we remain in opposition in Nala after winning this Ward, we will even more vigorously hold the failing ANC government to account now with increased numbers. The people of Nala deserve a government that delivers quality services, cuts corruption and opens access to jobs. The DA thanks all voters in Nala Ward 2 who came out yesterday to vote for change. The march to Election 2019 goes from strength to strength. The power to usher in change and reject looting and lies, is in the hands of the people of the Free State and South Africa. Only the DA will build one South Africa for all. Issued by Patricia Kopane, DA Free State Provincial Leader, 6 September 2018
