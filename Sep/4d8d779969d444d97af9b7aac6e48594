MEDIA RELEASE 17 September 2018 Safe conditions Sasol notes Solidarity’s claims that conditions at our Sasolburg Operations are unsafe. We do not agree with this claim and there is no indication that safety at our operations has been compromised. We are engaging the Department of Labour in this regard, as well as the local licensing authorities. Safety is a value at Sasol and we prioritise the safety and wellbeing of all personnel at all our operations. Sasolburg Operations Although there were some employees who did not arrive at the shift change at our Sasolburg Operations over the weekend, we activated contingency plans to minimise potential interruption to those particular activities.  We have internal industrial relations processes within Human Resources that all employees have the right of recourse on any concerns or problems that may arise. Secunda Operations As previously stated, with the demonstration at our Secunda Operations on 6 September, we experienced a temporary decrease in attendance by Solidarity members. This led to a decrease and delay in some planned activities to which Solidarity alludes. Separately to the scheduled shutdown at our Secunda Operations, there are other projects underway. Some of these projects experienced some slippage due to technical challenges but these have been resolved and the projects are virtually complete. We continue to ensure that our running operations and shutdown schedule progress safely, as planned, while closely monitoring the situation. Engagement with Solidarity Furthermore, Sasol has agreed to participate in the CCMA mediation process with Solidarity commencing 19 September 2018. National Bargaining Council The National Bargaining Council for the Chemical Industry (NBCCI) has withdrawn its suspension of our shutdown variation licence with immediate effect. The variation licence remains active. Statement issued by Alex Anderson, Head of Group Media Relations, Sasol Limited, 17 September 2018
