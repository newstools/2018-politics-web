EFF CONDEMNS SOUTH AFRICA'S DECISION TO RETURN ITS AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL Monday, 24 September, 2018 The EFF condemns South Africa's decision to return its ambassador to Israel. The South African government had recalled its ambassador to Israel following the May 14th massacre where 50 Palestinian people died. The decision to recall the South Africa's ambassador should have been followed by a complete shutdown of South Africa's mission to Israel. Israel is an apartheid state that subjects Palestinians to mass murder each year. They are engaged in a permanent crime against the humanity of Palestinians in both Gaza and West Bank. All peace and freedom loving countries in the world should isolate Israel through boycott, divestment and sanctions until they end their illegal and criminal occupation of Palestinian lands. The ANC government has once more shown its disregard of human rights. They have tumed their back on an important legacy that actually made our own freedom possible; which is international solitary through boycotts.
