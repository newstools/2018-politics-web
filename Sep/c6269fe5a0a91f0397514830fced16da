DA calls on MEC Lehari to explain Gupta involvement at NW schools 13 September 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West Province has written to the MEC for Education and Sports Development, Sello Lehari, asking him to explain how 77 schools in the North West Province have participated in a “drawing competition” by the Gupta-linked JIC Mining company without the approval of the Head of Department (HOD) of Education. This came to light when MEC Lehari and HOD Stephinah Semaswe appeared before the Portfolio Committee for Home Affairs during a hearing on the naturalization of the Gupta family this week. It was alleged that JIC Mining Company handed out cash prizes to learners who participated in a “drawing competition” to design wedding invitations for Vega Gupta’s infamous Sun City wedding in 2013. MEC Lehari must urgently table the report that has transpired from the hearing, as we believe that it is in the interest of the public to know whether the School Governing Bodies and parents of the 77 schools have granted consent for learners to participate in the competition sponsored by the JIC Mining company. The DA will lodge a Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) application in the event that the Department fails to table the report within thirty (30) days hereof. The MEC needs to explain how it came about that the Gupta family infiltrated the North West Department of Education to the extent that even schools have been pulled into their web of corruption. The DA would like to know the names of the schools, as well as the means by which they have been approached to participate in this competition. The people of North West need corruption-free schools where quality learning is prioritised. Under a DA-led government, learners will be protected from being the pawns in politically connected companies’ self-enrichment schemes.
