Decades of neglect by failing ANC has brought SA rail system to its knees 4 September 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng calls on for an urgent investigation on the cause of the collision between two trains that left around 100 people injured today. Two trains collided at Eloff Extension in Selby Johannesburg. Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC, Ismail Vadi must liaise with his national counterpart, Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande to launch an investigation into this serious safety issue. The DA notes will concern the safety of passengers on metrorail trains as numerous accidents have been reported yet the government has done nothing to ensure the safety of passengers. It is clear that there is little urgency on this matter by the failing ANC government. As our Premier Candidate for Gauteng, Solly Msimanga, hits the ground engaging with communities, more South Africans and residents of Gauteng will hear of our plans to ensure the safety of commuters. This will include giving provinces authority to manage the network as well as stabilising and modernising the current rail system, focus on upgrading the current signal system to phase out the manual signal to prevent further crashes and derailment and re-establish a dedicated rail police unit to provide security on our rail system. The DA wishes a speedy recovery to the injured passengers. The safety of passengers needs to come first and government has an obligation to ensure that this is the case on all public modes of transport.
