Plato has a great task on hand and must prove that he is a better mayor than MEC for Community Safety 19 September 2018 The DA's newly appointed mayor of Cape Town, Dan Plato, must prove that he can unite the divided DA councillors in the interest of all Cape Town residents. He will also have to show that he can do better than what he did as MEC for Community Safety, where he was not convincing in the fight against crime in the city, particularly in the Cape Flats. Plato will do well to, in the interest of the public, be honest with himself about the division in the ranks of the DA as well as the public's dissatisfaction about a number of matters, like excessive water and electricity tariffs. Other issues, like the exploitation of loyal tax payers and even the fact that the city is becoming less and less neat, are not going unnoticed by residents. Even the uncertainty created by the possibility that the DA leader, Mmusi Maimane, will stand as candidate for Western Cape premier contributed to the collective public mistrust among the people in the city and the rest of the province, which Plato now has to address. The FF Plus undertakes to do everything in its power to make a positive contribution in the council in the interest of all Cape Town residents. The party will, however, still take its role as opposition seriously and will hold the DA and its mayor accountable to ensure that the residents and loyal tax payers of the city are always put first.
