No investigation into sex for jobs allegations at Soweto Hospital 27 September 2018 There has been no investigation into the sex for jobs allegations against a manager at the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital in Jabulani, Soweto as the Gauteng Health Department claims “there was never a formal complaint laid with the institution.” This is according to a written reply I have received from Acting Health MEC Faith Mazibuko in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. I am astonished by this as employees at the hospital wrote in March last year to Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa, Gauteng Premier David Makhura and the Public Service Commission demanding that the implicated sex predator manager be investigated for mismanagement, sexual harassment, intimidation and unfair dismissals. It was also reported in September last year that an employee admitted to having had sexual relations with the manager from last year after he allegedly threatened to fire her “for buying her job”. She said he would ask her to come to work early or leave late so that he could force himself on her. Why has this been swept under the carpet? With regard to jobs for cash allegations at the hospital which were made last year, Mazibuko says: “The matter was handed over to the Hawks. The Hawks took statements from witnesses however a different case was opened with Jabulane SAPS for another group of employees who committed extortion against members of the public.” This is not good enough. The credible allegations that have been made of sex for jobs and cash need proper investigation and disciplinary action by the hospital management. I will continue to raise this matter in the Gauteng Legislature as sex pests and corruption should never be tolerated. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 27 September 2018
