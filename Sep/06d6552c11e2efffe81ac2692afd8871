Pikitup – Attempted murderers denied bail 07 September 2018 Today, I have been informed of the Court’s decision to deny bail to five suspects, accused of attempting to murder a Pikitup General Manager earlier this week. The suspects were part of protesters picketing outside Pikitup offices since Monday, demanding that they be employed by the City’s waste management company. It is alleged that, on Monday, the suspects assaulted the manager, dousing him with petrol and threatening to set him alight. Fortunately, the manager was able to escape. The City is pleased that the Court has seen fit to keep these dangerous criminals off our streets and send message that, wonton lawless and violence won’t be tolerated in our society. In addition to this, the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD), alongside other law enforcement authorities are hot on the trail of other protestors said to be involved in disrupting services and targeted acts of violence against Pikitup property. The City will continue to engage with our law enforcement authorities so as to provide all support needed to secure a conviction. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our workers across Pikitup for their efforts in assisting to service our residents even under difficult conditions. I would also like to thank your residents for their continued support and patience whilst Pikitup and the City work towards normalising service deliver following disruptions caused by protests.
