ANC statement on racial attack in Machadodorp, Mpumalanga 12 September 2018 The ANC is shocked at the despicable criminal conduct of two white men who were caught on video brutally attacking a black man, in what appears to be a racially motivated attack.  Their shameless disregard of the police officers at the scene, who clearly were trying to reason with them, demonstrates their disdain for the rule of law. Such conduct has no place in our society and those who believe they are above the law should be ashamed to call themselves South African.  No citizen has a right to take the law into their own hands, irrespective of the circumstances.  We welcome the swift action of the police to take these suspects into custody. We similarly condemn the actions of criminal elements in the community who burnt down a shop and two trucks in the process of protesting the handling of the two suspects by the police.  The ANC appeals to the community to allow law enforcement authorities to do their work without engaging in a behaviour that mimics that of the suspects.
