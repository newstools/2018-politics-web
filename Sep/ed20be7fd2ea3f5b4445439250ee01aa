EFF WELCOMES CONCOURT JUDGEMENT THAT "HIT THE BOER" SONG IS NOT RACIST Thursday, 13 September 2018 The EFF welcomes the Constitutional Court outcome in the matter of Duncamec vs Gaylard, which ruled that the struggle song "Hit the Boer" is not racist. This is after the company Duncamec dismissed workers belonging to NUMSA for singing the struggle song during their strike against the company in 2013. We welcome this judgement as an important step in dealing with white supremacy. Often, white people, many who remain racist, seek to silence black peoples' struggle songs that were composed to call out their racism. These struggle songs are historically made to give confidence and voice to black people when confronted with white supremacy, particularly in workplaces. The EFF is confident that by the same logic which was detailed in a unanimous Constitutional Court judgement, even "Kill the Boer" song could never be considered as hate speech. Struggle songs are an important heritage in our country, which must be preserved as a tool through which black people spoke back to colonial and apartheid power. These songs remain relevant as long as white supremacy and anti-black racism exists. Statement issued by the EFF, 13 September 2018
