DA WC lays charges against DAFF DDG 17 September 2018 Today, 17 September 2018, I laid charges against Deputy Director-General, Siphokazi Ndudane of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) following damning revelations of her involvement in crime and corruption related to the illegal abalone trade in the province. The allegations, which are included in a charge sheet from an internal Departmental disciplinary process dated and signed on 3 September 2018, case number SN11/07/2018 include, among others, 155 counts of fraud, 37 counts of theft, extortion, forgery, defeating the ends of justice, insubordination, and the contravention of section 217 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic 108 of 1996. The Department and Minister Senzeni Zokwana have yet to take any decisive disciplinary action against Ms Ndudane, or against any DAFF senior officials allegedly implicated in these charges including Financial Management Acting Chief Director, Ms Nazima Parker and Acting Chief Director, Thembalethu Vico. Today’s charges serve to force National Government to bring the DAFF to book and prosecute those implicated in crimes which directly affect Western Cape fisheries. On Thursday, 13 September 2018, I also wrote a letter to Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, requesting an urgent investigation into the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in light of the abovementioned damning revelations. As the DA in the Western Cape, we remain committed to protecting and preserving the vitality of our oceans, along with the important economy and jobs they sustain for our people. This includes rooting out the corruption which festers at the heart of the DAFF and threatens to collapse the Western Cape’s fisheries. We will not rest until this Department is cleaned out and functioning to best serve the people who depend on it.
