#StateCaptureInquiry: Legal team asks for #GuptaLeaks hard drives to be submitted as evidence 27 September 2018 The legal team at the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture has asked the chairperson to allow three hard drives, that contain what has become known as the #GuptaLeaks, to be admitted as evidence. Between 200 000 and 300 000 emails were leaked to the media a year ago, and they set in motion a series of exposés on the controversial Gupta family. The emails showed how the Guptas – who had the ear of former president Jacob Zuma and enriched his son Duduzane through numerous directorships – had infiltrated numerous state-owned enterprises and laundered money to fund private projects and to bank accounts in Dubai and India. Lawyer Brian Carrin, who is currently testifying before the commission, said he had met with one whistleblower called "Stan" through his friend. Carrin said his first meeting with Stan was in February 2017. He, however, declined to reveal how Stan came into possession of the initial hard drive, saying it would reveal his identify. "We obviously were concerned that either Stan, [or] whoever was in possession of these hard drives may be identified and confiscated." He said the whistleblower had indicated that the information on the hard drive contained emails from Ashu Chawla from Sahara Computers. "He was visibly nervous, he was in a state of shock – it was a difficult meeting," he said. Currin said that the second whistleblower, who he referred to as "John", also played a significant role. The hearing continues. News24
