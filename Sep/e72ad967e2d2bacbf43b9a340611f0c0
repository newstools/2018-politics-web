Failing ANC backtracks on e-Tolls 10 September 2018 The National Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande, is now backtracking on the failing ANC’s announcement earlier this year that e-Tolls are not working and need to be relooked. The DA has learnt that Minister Nzimande is now reluctant to scrap e-Tolls because he wants the gantries to pay for the R67 billion that was needed for the South African National Roads Agencies (Sanral). This about-turn by the ANC, shows that they are not serious about scrapping e-tolls and are merely using this as an election ploy to curry favour with voters. The same empty promises were made in 2014 after the failing ANC in Gauteng suffered badly at the polls. Recently, Gauteng Premier David Makhura admitted that the e-Toll issue was a major reason why the ANC did so poorly in the last national and provincial elections. The DA has been against e-Tolls from the onset as it places enormous pressure on our residents, who are already struggling due to the failing ANC’s mismanagement of the economy, resulting in more people being oppressed by poverty and unemployment. It is high-time that an alternative solution to e-Tolls is found, and that Premier provides tangible feedback on his engagement with the President, and explain why he and Minister Nzimande are singing two different tunes. Only change led by a DA-government that puts the people first, will ensure that we build systems that makes life better for the residents of Gauteng.
