Fire at Gauteng Health Head Office 5 September 2018 I am distressed at the fire that has broken out at the top floor Head Office of Gauteng Health Department. The cause of the fire needs to be investigated speedily, but we also need to know why complaints by employees have been ignored about the poor conditions at this building. It has been alleged that the Bank of Lisbon building contravenes safety legislation in many areas and is condemned. I have asked a question about the conditions of this building to the Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development but they are overdue in replying. The safety concerns of staff in this building should have been taken seriously and addressed. This fire has led to the tragedy death of a Fireman. I express my deepest condolences to his family and I hope there are no more casualties. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Health, 5 September 2018
