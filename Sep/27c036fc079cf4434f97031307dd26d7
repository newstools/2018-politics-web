Additional resources have been sourced through donor funds for selected smaller municipalities and the Financial Management Grant is made available to all municipalities needing assistance. There are at least a 100 regionally based Local Government Sector Education and Training Authority accredited training providers listed on the National Treasury website to also support regional based training. After extensive consultation processes, the Minister of Finance will promulgate an amendment to, amongst others, regulations 15 and 18 of the Municipal Minimum Competency Regulations, to allow all officials 18 months from date of appointment to obtain the relevant competency levels. It will be mandatory for all municipal councils to make the latter a condition of employment in the employment contracts of effected officials. These proposed amendments will be promulgated shortly.
