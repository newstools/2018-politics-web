Euthanasia murder accused Sean Davison granted R20 000 bail as 'new info' comes to light 19 September 2018 The founder of right-to-die organisation, DignitySA, Sean Davison, was granted R20 000 bail on Wednesday after he was arrested on a murder charge in Cape Town relating to a 2013 incident. Davison was arrested on Tuesday, apparently over the death of his friend Anrich Burger in 2013. Burger became a quadriplegic after a car crash. He appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, where he was granted bail with conditions. State prosecutor Megan Blows told the court that he was charged with premeditated murder and that "new information has come to light... the accused might have committed other similar offences". Davison told the court that he intended pleading not guilty. "It is and has always been my contention that I have not committed any offence as alleged in this matter," his lawyer read from an affidavit. More to follow. News24
