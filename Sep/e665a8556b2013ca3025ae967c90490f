DA requests urgent meeting with SASSA CEO on why social grant recipients were turned away The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Acting South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) CEO, Abraham Mahlangu, to request an urgent meeting on why qualifying beneficiaries have been turned away from SASSA offices when trying to apply for their grants. The DA has received many calls, messages and emails from beneficiaries who have been denied access to social grants because SASSA cannot capture biometric applications. Some people have waited since June to access their grants. There is already a significant backlog in the capturing of data which could reach crisis levels by the end of September. SASSA’s Roodepoort branch and many others across the country are allegedly not accepting new applications because of problems with their biometric systems and recipients were reportedly told their applications cannot be backdated. For millions of South Africans, social grants are the only source of income. Children, the elderly and the disabled are especially vulnerable and it appears that there is still no plan to ensure they can apply for grants and receive their grants on time. That qualifying beneficiaries are denied the opportunity to register and receive social grants means the difference between putting food on the table or going hungry. The DA will ensure that we get answers from SASSA about their failure to give beneficiaries the money they are entitled to as well as their failure to assist them as required.
