ANC hits back at cash-in-transit accused former employee's 'warped imagination' 4 September 2018 The ANC has not taken kindly to claims made by its former employee Errol Velile Present, who is accused in connection with a Dobsonville cash-in-transit heist. The party referred to his testimony in court and said he had a "warped imagination". In his bail hearing in the Roodepoort Magistrate's Court on Friday, he disputed that he was a volunteer as the party previously claimed. "It wouldn't make sense for me to be a volunteer for 14 years. I would say it is a joke." But national spokesperson Pule Mabe said in a statement on Monday that "it is immaterial whether he was a volunteer or employed permanently". "Present is alleged to have committed serious crimes during the very employ he refers to in his affidavit, culminating in his immediate dismissal. Should he be aggrieved on the processes followed, Present is welcome to approach any institution that will afford him satisfactory recourse," Mabe said. Present shares the dock with co-accused Itumeleng Manama, 40, Bheki Biyela, 38, and Zakhele Zondi, 37. They have been charged with robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder and the possession of suspected stolen vehicles in connection with a heist in Dobsonville, Soweto in which a security guard was shot and wounded. The case continues on September 11. News24
