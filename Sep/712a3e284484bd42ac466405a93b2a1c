EFF TO APPEAR IN NORTH GAUTENG HIGH COURT TO CHALLENGE RIOTOUS ASSEMBLIES ACT Wednesday, 19 September, 2018 Tomorrow Thursday 20 September 2018 the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria will be hearing two separate Full Bench applications involving the EFF. The first Full Bench application is a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Riotous Assembly Act of 1956, an apartheid piece of legislation which was enacted to fight the Freedom Charter. That Act was the basis of the famous Treason Trial of Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and others. The ANC government has used that apartheid legislation to charge the EFF President and Commander in Chief, Julius Malema, for calling for the occupation of vacant land by the landless masses of our people. If the court agrees that the Riotous Assemblies Act is unconstitutional then the charges currently pending in Bloemfontein and Newcastle will be dropped. The second one is an application for Leave to appeal brought by Former President Jacob Zuma against last December judgment of Judge President Mlambo for Zuma to pay the costs of reviewing Thuli Madonsela's remedial action for the institution of the State Capture inquiry, personally and from his own pocket. The EFF and other parties will be opposing Zuma's application. He must pay the costs personally. Both of these cases have huge implications for the people of South Africa. They relate to the first and seventh Non-negotiable Pillars of Economic Freedom: Land and the call for a corrupt-free government. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 19 September 2018
