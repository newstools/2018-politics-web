Minister Mapisa-Nqakula refuses to detail costs for spouse’s 29 international trips 3 September 2018 The DA will write to the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, demanding that she immediately provides an answer on the full cost of the travels taken by her spouse, Charles Nqakula, to accompany her on official visits. In a reply, which details how Mr Nqakula joined his wife on 29 international trips over the last four years, the Department did not provide the cost of all the travels even though the question was explicitly asked. Mapisa-Nqakula must also inform the public whether the flights taken were commercial or chartered. The Minister has repeatedly claimed that her department does not have the money to adequately perform its functions. Yet there is money for her to be accompanied by her spouse to destinations such as Paris, New York, Abu Dhabi and London. Mr Nqakula is an MP and the Chairperson of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. Given his other commitments, it is astounding that he has the time to travel so extensively to accompany his wife. DA will not stand by while the people’s money is abused and will ensure that public representatives that are found guilty are held accountable.
