City’s delivery of 488 title deeds marks a life of home ownership for Soweto community 20 September 2018 Today, the Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg Cllr Herman Mashaba, and MMC for Housing, Cllr Meshack Van Wyk, handed over 488 title deeds to beneficiaries in Soweto. The delivery of title deeds forms part of our multi-party government’s commitment to provide safe and affordable housing for the residents of the City. It is in accordance with the 2017/18 Integrated Development Plan’s priorities to ensure pro-poor development that addresses inequality, poverty and providing meaningful redress. “This is a step in the right direction to restore the dignity our people, especially communities that are disadvantaged as a result of South Africa’s regressive apartheid spatial legacy that has left many dispossessed of home ownership,” said Mayor Mashaba about the significance of the day. Home ownership empowers our residents by giving them and their families the dignity of a place to call home. One such beneficiary who is empowered today is 71-year-old Gladys Cebekhulu from Zola, Soweto. Her parents have been residing at the property since 1963. She was born in 1947 and has been living there since. She is delighted to finally receive a title deed and now have her name to the property. Mayor Mashaba remains committed to this cause, one that is pivotal to the cause for socio-political and economic liberties for all South Africans.
