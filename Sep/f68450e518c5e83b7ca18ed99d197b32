Stanger crime crisis: DA requests meeting with Police Minister 17 September 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has requested an urgent meeting with the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele as well as the Minister of Justice, Michael Masutha, to devise an intervention that will restore order and bring peace to the streets of Stanger. Answers to the DA's parliamentary questions revealed that between the Stanger Police and the Courts, there has been a mere 1.4% conviction rate for murder, rape, robbery, hijacking and housebreaking. When one looks at each category specifically the figures are more alarming, including a conviction rate for murder of 2.7%, rape of 6% and hijacking of 0%. On 19 June 2018, the DA undertook an oversight insepction to the Stanger police station during which senior management literally ran away to avoid accounting to MPs. It is now clear that there is a crisis in Stanger that requires urgent national intervention to restore law and order in this community. The people of Stanger live in constant fear that they will be victims of violent crimes without a police service to assist them and a justice system that will prevent criminals from roaming the streets. A DA government will ensure that law and order is maintained in our communities and that there are effective arrests, prosecutions and convictions of criminals.
