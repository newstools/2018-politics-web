KZN farm murder suspect arrested A 30-year-old man has been arrested on charges of murder and robbery committed at a Creighton farm in KwaZulu-Natal, police said on Wednesday. Police arrested the suspect on Tuesday, four days after a couple at Lynn Avis Farm was accosted by three armed men, police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said. They were allegedly tied up before 66-year-old Peter Scott was shot dead. Netwerk24 previously reported that Scott's first name is Campbell. "The suspect was found at his homestead with a firearm and six rounds of ammunition, as well as property stolen from the victims' home, including their cellphones," Naicker said. "The suspect will be charged and will appear in court soon." Police were still on a manhunt for the remaining suspects. Acting provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi commended those who were involved in the investigation. "It is totally unacceptable that people are killed for items of such a low value. The police will not rest when people are killed in their own homes by greedy criminals," he said. "We will hunt them down and ensure that they are placed before a court to answer for their crimes." News24
