DA strongly condemns alleged rape of minor at Pretoria restaurant The DA strongly condemns the alleged rape and sexual assault of a 6 year-old girl at a Dros restaurant in Silverton, Pretoria over the weekend. It is alleged that a 21 year-old man allegedly followed the little girl, who was in the playing area, to the toilet inside the restaurant where he raped her (see report). The accused was caught and the police were called to the scene and immediately arrested the suspect. The alleged rapist appeared in court yesterday charged with rape, possession of drugs, intimidation and assault with intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The accused was remanded in custody and the case has been postponed to 2 October for further investigation. The fact that this incident occurred in a public place is a clear indication that our children are not safe anywhere. The escalating rate of the sexual abuse and rape of women and children raises serious concerns about their safety which is under siege. According to the 2017/18 Gauteng crime statistics, rape has increased by 4, 7 %, and sexual offenses increased by 5, 7% compared to last year. The murder of women and children also accounted to 16, 8 % which is 657 murders. We urge all eatery places to ensure that there are stringent measures in place to ensure children's safety and that there should be an adult to monitor the children at the play stations. The DA will picket outside the court when the accused appears on the 2nd October; we demand that the accused must be denied bail and receives a harsh sentence.
