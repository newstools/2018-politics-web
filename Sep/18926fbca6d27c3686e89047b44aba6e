Madikizela not parting with phone in WCape premier leak probe Western Cape DA leader Bonginkosi Madikizela is within his rights to not hand over his cellphone and laptop as the party tries to find out who leaked party leader Mmusi Maimane's apparent bid to be premier, DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach said on Tuesday. "I asked for the laptops and the cellphones to try and ascertain where the leak came from, not suggesting any of them is the leak," said Breytenbach. "I've got lots of devices from lots of people, but not from Bongi. "...It's his perfectly good right. It's not a problem from me at all." She said the information was in a target group and the party wanted to find out how it got out. Commenting on the issue, Madikizela told News24 it was "old news" that he opted to not hand his devices over. He would not discuss it publicly until after a party meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, to discuss the issue. Madikizela is understood to have been a front runner to succeed Helen Zille. However, MEC for Economic Opportunities Alan Winde was announced as the party's premier candidate at a press conference on September 19. Community Safety MEC Dan Plato is expected to take over from Patricia de Lille as mayor of Cape Town on November 1. News24
