Pupil, 17, allegedly stabs teacher to death over 'feeding' argument A 17-year-old boy who attends a high school in Zeerust, North West, is facing a murder charge after allegedly stabbing a teacher to death on Thursday. According to police, the incident happened after 11:00 on Thursday. The teacher, aged 24, was in a classroom when the pupil allegedly walked in and stabbed him. "The teacher was transported to Dinokana health centre where he was certified dead on arrival," police spokesperson Sam Tselenyane told News24. A murder case has been registered and the pupil is in police custody. Education department officials were at the school after the incident, basic education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said. "It seems there was an altercation yesterday (Wednesday) regarding feeding the boy. "He was in a queue and was reprimanded by the teacher. He took it personally and went home and came back today and found the teacher inside the classroom where he stabbed him," Mhlanga said. Mhlanga added that the matter was now being handled by the police, but the department would offer counselling at the school on Friday. News24
