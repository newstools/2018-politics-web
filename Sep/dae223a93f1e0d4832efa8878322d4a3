Parliament on the Constitutional Court judgment on the use of dagga/cannabis in private homes 18 September 2018 Parliament notes the judgment today by the Constitutional Court on the use of dagga or cannabis in private homes and the 24-month period within which the national legislature is expected to rectify constitutional defects in the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act of 1992 and the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act of 1965. This could entail Parliament introducing a new Bill. Alternatively, theÂ Executive, who were party to the litigation, could introduce a new Bill to give effect to the order of the Court. Parliament is in possession of the judgment and the relevant structures in Parliament will take a decision on the manner to give effect to the judgment. As required by the Constitution, the public will have an opportunity to make submissions during the processes in Parliament.
