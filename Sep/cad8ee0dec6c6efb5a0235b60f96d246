Tshwane building housing govt department to be reopened after shutdown over safety 18 September 2018 Officials of the Department of Justice and Correctional Services are expected to return to work on Tuesday as the Poyntons Building has been given the green light to resume operations. "The emergency services department of the City of Tshwane has rescinded the prohibition notice on the head office of the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) at Poyntons Building in Tshwane, with immediate effect," the department's Logan Maistry said in a statement on Monday evening. The prohibition has been lifted with effect from Monday. The building,Â which houses the Department of Correctional Services head office, was shut down by Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga last week on Wednesday on the basis that it was unsafe. Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha said he decided not to challenge Msimanga's decision through the courts as "he was satisfied that ongoing engagements" would lead to the reopening of the building. "The emergency services department conducted an inspection on 16 September 2018 on the requirements as agreed to during the onsite meeting on 13 September 2018, and is subsequently satisfied that critical requirements were implemented as agreed to," Maistry explained. Masutha said in a statement that he was also satisfied that safety concerns around the building had been addressed. "As a caring government, we need to take the safety of our staff members seriously. "I have been receiving regular briefings from DCS management and I am pleased that we are well on our way to resolving all issues raised by the City of Tshwane," Masutha said in the statement. News24
