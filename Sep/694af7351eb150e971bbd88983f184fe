SACP welcomes Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo's ruling on the Guptas 13 September 2018 The South African Communist Party welcomes the ruling delivered today in Johannesburg by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo dismissing the application by the Guptas for leave to cross-examine witnesses at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The Guptas are implicated in the corruption of state capture and have since disappeared from South Africa. They are evading arrest by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation and prosecution by the National Prosecuting Authority. They have indicated that they have no intention to return to South Africa, including to appear at the Commission in the country. The SACP is calling on the relevant law enforcement authorities to hunt down and bring to book all fugitives from the law.
