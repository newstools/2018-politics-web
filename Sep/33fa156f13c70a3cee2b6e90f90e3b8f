Gigaba must appear before inquiry on Gupta naturalisation next week 5 September 2018 Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba must appear before the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs next week for an inquiry into the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family. The committee set aside three days next week – Wednesday to Friday – to hold the investigation into the process followed in the naturalisation of the Guptas. The committee has concluded the initial phase of the inquiry, the collection of all relevant information and has identified gaps which need to be clarified by certain people to help the committee make a decision, according to a statement from committee chairperson Hlomani Chauke on Tuesday. The committee has resolved to call the following people to give evidence – the MEC for the North West department of education and sports development, the head of department of the North West department of education and sports development, former home affairs director general Mkuseli Apleni, former home affairs employee GC Christians and Gigaba. Any additions to the list will be determined by what information is received from the initial hearings. The committee considers it crucial for the identified individuals to attend the hearings and will request the Speaker to summon those that are not prepared to appear. "This matter has been in the public domain without resolution for too long. The committee is thus intending to bring this matter to finality," said Chauke. News24
