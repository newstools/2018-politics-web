Tom Moyane must submit the Lovells and Motau reports before 13 March 2018 The DA has written to the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Finance (SCOF), Yunus Carrim MP, asking him to request SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane, to submit the Hogan Lovells and Adv. Motau reports on Jonas Makwakwa before 13 March 2018. Moyane is scheduled to appear before SCOF on the 13th of March 2018 and it is essential that these reports are submitted in time to enable Parliament to perform its oversight function on the controversial circumstances that saw Makwakwa reinstated as the second in command at SARS. Should Moyane fail to submit the reports as requested, I will recommend that Parliament considers taking legal action to force him to release the reports. Makwakwa’s suspension, triggered by findings made by the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), was controversially lifted based on reports conducted by Hogan Lovells and Adv. Motau. This was despite the fact that these reports did not investigate the allegations that the suspension was based on. Moyane has done everything in his power to protect Makwakwa even to the point of misleading and possibly lying to Parliament, as reported in the Daily Maverick on the 7th of March 2018. The DA will ensure that when Moyane’s appearance before SCOF is used to make him account on why Makwakwa was reinstated after being suspended over serious allegations of involvement in illegal activates and financial crimes. Moyane must understand that the ‘jig is up’ and his attempts to further delay the release of the Lovells and Motau reports only serves to cast doubt over his suitability to continue leading the tax revenue service.
