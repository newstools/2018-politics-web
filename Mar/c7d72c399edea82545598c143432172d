A man is judged by the company he keeps: Former business partner of Ace found guilty of fraud 6 March 2018 The resignation of the current premier of the Free State, Ace Magashule, is long overdue. For the past nine years, the province suffered at the hands of Magashule as a result of corruption, fraud and the theft of tax payers’ money that was supposed to have been used to improve the lives of Free State residents. The FF Plus welcomes the Free State High Court’s conviction of Isaac Seoe, a former business partner of Magashule, on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering and demands that further investigations into corruption and tender fraud be conducted thoroughly and speedily. In 2014, Seoe the former chairperson of the Free State Development Corporation (FDC) was spotted with Magashule at a Shell fuel station in Phuthaditjhaba in the Free State. Recently, Magashule’s daughter acquired the fuel station by means of a controversial agreement with the FDC. Magashule does not have the leadership qualities that are needed to ensure that the Free State is administered in a corruption and fraud free way. In the first place, adequate measures to ensure that corruption does not take place are lacking and secondly, investigations are not done properly and punitive measures are not enforced. The Free State High Court must make an example of Seoe by means of the sentence imposed on him. Issued by Tammy Wessels, FF Plus MPL: Free State Legislature, 6 March 2018
