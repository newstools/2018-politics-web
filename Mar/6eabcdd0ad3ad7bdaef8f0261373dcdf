DA demands justice for sexual abuse victim 20 March 2018 The DA demands justice for the underage victim who was allegedly sexually abused by the former Emfuleni Mayor, Simon Mofokeng. The DA picketed outside the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s court today during the court proceedings of the former Mayor Mofokeng who is facing charges related to the sexual grooming of the 14 year old victim. See photo here. This case was postponed pending further investigation. As the DA, we want to send a stern message that enough is enough and the scourge of sexual abuse against women and children must stop! Powerful men who hold influential positions in society should stop using their positions to abuse the most vulnerable in our society. By exposing the former Mayor’s alleged abuse of power, the DA hopes that many more young girls and women will summon the courage to speak out and lay charges against the perpetrators. The DA will continue to demand justice for the victim and that Mofokeng faces the full might of the law.  We also call for the speedy wrap-up of investigations so that the victim and her family can have closure and start rebuilding their lives.
