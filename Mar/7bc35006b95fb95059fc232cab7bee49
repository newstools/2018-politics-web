DA condemns EFF Shivambu’s assault of journalist The DA strongly condemns the EFF Deputy President, Floyd Shivambu’s, assault of a Netwerk24 journalist, Adrian de Kock, on the Parliamentary precinct today. The DA’s Deputy Chief Whip, Mike Waters, will be reporting Shivambu to Parliament’s Ethics Committee for investigation and action. We strongly encourage de Kock will lay criminal charges against Shivambu. Shivambu’s disgraceful behaviour is indicative what has become an aggressive attitude towards the media by the EFF. Just last week, EFF Leader, Julius Malema, accused eNCA of being a platform which “perpetuate white supremacy”. The attacks on eNCA have allegedly, according to the broadcaster, included threatening messages to its journalists. Malema also accused the SABC of allowing “whiteness” to take over, after hiring a white journalist. The SABC is a public broadcaster, which caters for all South Africans across all racial and cultural groups. We commend it for head-hunting talent to join its ranks, and not be intimidated by the EFF’s racially-divisive bully tactics. While from time to time, disagreements may arise between political parties and the media, those disagreements should never result in violence or using racially-divisive language. The DA believes that a vibrant media is the cornerstone of any thriving democracy. The DA will continue to fight for the protection of the free media and independent reporting, and we will oppose anyone who attempts to stifle media voices.
