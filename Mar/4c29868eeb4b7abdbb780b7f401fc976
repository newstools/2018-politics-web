SABC has spent R22 million on Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s legal fees 15 March 2018 The SABC has spent over R22 million to pay for the legal costs of its former Chief Operating Officer, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, a reply to a DA parliamentary question reveals. In the reply, former Communications Minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, reveals that the public broadcaster has since 2013 paid millions of rands in legal fees for Motsoeneng and the amount “might increase as other matters are ongoing”. Some of the legal fees include, but are not limited to action taken by: SABC News anchor Vuyo Mvoko – R1 186 184 Former SABC head of news, Verona Duwarkah – R505 985 Helen Suzman Foundation – R1 659 490 Democratic Alliance – R5 370 828 Various Board Matters – R4 990 985 This R22 million by far exceeds the R15 million taxpayers have had to fork out on former President Jacob Zuma’s legal fees. Just like the other litigious delinquent, Jacob Zuma, Motsoeneng must pay this money back to the public purse. The public should not have to pay for this one man wrecking ball’s legal fees. In addition to the R21 million the Special Investigating Unit is pursuing in Motseoneng’s debt to the SABC, this R22 million must be added, making what he owes R43 million. Every single cent must be recovered from him. Hlaudi left a trail of destruction in his wake. He flouted policy processes; demoralised, victimised and purged staff; brought the SABC’s newsroom into disrepute and left the public broadcaster on the brink of collapse. The DA calls on the SABC to personally hold Hlaudi responsible for this excessive amount of money, that can be much better spent on paying off its debts, investing in content development, finding new talent, informing and educating the public, and restoring the SABC’s image as a credible and reliable news source.
