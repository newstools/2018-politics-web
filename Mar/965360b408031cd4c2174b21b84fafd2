Ladybrand farm murder heightens need for rural safety units The DA is horrified to learn of another farm attack in the Free State that resulted in the brutal loss of life of the farm manager at the Brandenburg Farm, in the Ladybrand district. Upon returning home from running errands in town, Mr Tankiso Pharoe and his wife were attacked by two unknown assailants who were hiding in waiting for them. Mr Pharoe and his wife were tied and dragged to a field where Mr Pharoe was brutally stabbed and hacked to death and his wife was raped. Mrs Pharoe alleges the unknown assailants may be citizens of Lesotho. The DA expresses our heartfelt sympathy to the Pharoe family on their tragic loss. These savage attacks on farmers and farm workers can no longer be tolerated. The DA insists that the SAPS establish rural safety units with the sole purpose of protecting rural inhabitants â€“ both farmworkers and farmers. It is noted that this attack occurred in an area which is supposedly being patrolled by the South African Defence Force precisely to secure the South African and Lesotho border and to protect nearby farm dwellers from cross border attacks. Clearly this is not good enough. Only specialised rural safety units within the SAPS, which are fully resourced, will be able to deal with this scourge which continues to plague rural communities.
