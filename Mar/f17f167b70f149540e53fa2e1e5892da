Gauteng ANC Government losing the battle against financial misconduct 14 March 2018 According to the Completed Disciplinary Proceedings on Financial Misconduct 2016/17 published by the Public Service Commission, Gauteng accounts for 33% of financial misconduct reported across all provincial governments in South Africa. The total amount of money involved in disciplinary investigations into financial misconduct in Gauteng amounted to R198 312 821.71, of which only R282 428.80 has been recovered. The Gauteng Department of Human Settlements racked up the lion’s share at an amount of R171 541 909.80. Astoundingly, the department only managed to complete four cases of financial misconduct in the 2016/17 financial year of which no funds were recovered. The Department of Education incurred an amount of R9 159 857.08, while the Department of Roads and Transport R17 000 000.00. Neither of these departments managed to recover any of this money. It is imperative that these public funds are recovered and put to use to provide residents with the services that they so desperately need. Under the watch of Gauteng Premier David Makhura, the provincial government has experienced a growing number of reports of financial misconduct. Year in and year out, the Premier announces a new strategy to arrest the rot in this ANC administration, yet time and again he is proven to be a man of talk rather than action. The DA is committed to running efficient and clean administrations. In the cities of Tshwane and Johannesburg we have taken bold steps to rid the system of those who seek to enrich themselves at the cost of residents. Come 2019, the DA will bring about the same Total Change to the people of Gauteng as it has done in the places we govern. Instead of talking about measures to change the way government can work better, we will action total change to the system to the benefit of those whom the ANC has left behind.
