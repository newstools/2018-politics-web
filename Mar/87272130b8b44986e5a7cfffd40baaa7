THANK YOU WORLD It is with great appreciation that TAU SA took notice of several voices that were raised abroad about the situation of South African farmers. "We especially thank the Australian government for the fact that they want to ease their immigration channels if the situation in South Africa becomes unsustainable. It's a wonderful gesture but we truly hope it will never be needed to use," said the president of TAU SA, Mr. Louis Meintjes. Mr. Meintjes said it is regrettable that the Minister of International Affairs, Lindiwe Sisulu, considers it necessary to call the Australian representative in South Africa to her office in the hope of receiving an official apology. "We hope Australia will not offer an apology, because the facts on which the possible easing of visa requirements are considered for South African farmers is completely correct, and no excuse is required if no lie is told. On the contrary, the ANC and the EFF should rather apologize for their persistent lie that the farmers stole the land,"said Mr. Meintjes. Mr. Meintjes also expressed his appreciation for Flemish students who are organising a silent protests against the murders of South African farmers on March 22. "Thank you, World," was Mr. Meintjes' words. "We are grateful that TAU SA's international actions over the years were not in vain and that the world took note of our problems." Statement issued by TAU SA, 16 March 2018
