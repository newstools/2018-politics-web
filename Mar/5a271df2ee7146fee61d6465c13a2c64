Makwakwa is gone, Moyane should follow 14 March 2018 The DA welcomes the resignation of the Chief Officer of Business and Individual Taxes, Jonas Makwakwa, from the South African Revenue Service (SARS) today. This is a step in the right direction. However, SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane, still remains despite doing everything in his power to protect Makwakwa, even to the point of possibly misleading Parliament. Makwakwa is a deeply compromised individual and SARS will be better without him. The Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) found that suspicious amounts of money had ended up in Makwakwa and his girlfriend, Kelly-Ann Elskie’s bank accounts. The investigation into these suspicious transactions as well as his conduct at SARS must continue and should be extended the role played by Moyane in ensuring Makwakwa retained his position at SARS.
