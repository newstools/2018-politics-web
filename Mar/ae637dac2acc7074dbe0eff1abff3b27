Atul Gupta a registered voter - IEC 7 March 2018 Cape Town - "A certain Atul Gupta" is indeed a registered voter on the South African voters roll, the Electoral Commission of South Africa confirmed on Wednesday. IEC deputy chairperson Terry Tselane said Gupta was properly registered at a primary school in Saxonwold. The IEC said voters must be South African citizens and in possession of a barcoded ID or smartcard. "This appears to be a legitimate registration," he said.
