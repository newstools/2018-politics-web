Shaun Abrahams must announce reinstatement of charges against Zuma 15 March 2018 The DA is keenly awaiting the decision by the National Director of Public Prosecution (NDPP), Shaun Abrahams, on whether or not former president Jacob Zuma should stand trial on corruption charges. The head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has run out of ways to delay his decision on the matter and the DA’s nine-year battle to have the charges against Zuma reinstated has finally come to a head. The time has arrived for the NPA to reinstate the 783 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering against Zuma. The DA will accept nothing less. It is a victory for the DA but also for South Africa that events have reached this point. As a result of our dogged, unwavering pursuit of justice we will all know, today or in the days to come, whether or not Zuma will finally have his day in court. Zuma cannot be allowed to walk scot-free if he is found guilty of any of the charges brought against him. South Africans have waited too long for the verdict and Abrahams must now put an end to his delaying tactics.
