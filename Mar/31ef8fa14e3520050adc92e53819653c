EFF WELCOMES THE SUSPENSION AND DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AGAINST TOM MOYANE 20 March 2018 The EFF welcomes the suspension of the head of SARS, Tom Moyane following a disciplinary process that has been instituted against him. We reject the idea of summarily releasing him without any due process, this includes a resignation. A disciplinary process allows him to present his case against all allegations in ways that give any decision thereafter due credibility. Often many top executives in state institutions are released or resign before the issues for which they are being released are cleared. In addition, merely by releasing them, it looks like a purge of one faction by the other. The rule of law dictates that no one must be fired without due process. This, even Mr. Moyane deserves due process and if those who have a case against him are confident, they will present it with distinction. In as much as we in the EFF would welcome a new head of SARS to rebuild the credibility of the institution, we are even more committed to the principles of the rule of law and natural justice.
