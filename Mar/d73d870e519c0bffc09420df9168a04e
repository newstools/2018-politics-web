EFF welcomes the ConCourt judgment dismissing CASAC's application to stop NPA from announcing its decision on charging Zuma 14 March 2018 The EFF welcomes the Constitutional Court decision to dismiss the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac), which sought to delay the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Shaun Abrahams from announcing a decision whether Jacob Zuma should be prosecuted. Zuma has been asking to have his day in court and he must be given such an opportunity at the earliest convenience. He must face all the charges of corruption, fraud and racketeering relating to his dealings with the convicted criminal Schabir Shaik We call on Shaun Abrahams to immediately make the announcement and in same breath step down as the NPA head. The Gauteng North High Court has ruled that his appointment was improper and her should vacate office. Abrahams must do the honorable thing and step down instead of waiting for the Constitutional Court and Ramaphosa to do so. Nothing will restore confidence in the NPA and the rule of law than Zuma being charged and Abrahams stepping down. This will give the NPA a clean opportunity to rebuild its confidence lost under the Zuma years. Issued by Mbuyiseni Quintin Ndlozi, National Spokesperson, EFF, 14 March 2018
