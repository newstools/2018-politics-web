DA welcomes Hawks raid at Supra’s offices in North West 8 March 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the long overdue raid by the Hawks at Premier Supra Mahumapelo’s offices this morning. After years of stealing from the people of the province, and a litany of charges and investigations, the wheels of justice are finally turning. Mahamampelo must now face all the allegations against him and also account for his relationship with the Gupta family and involvement in State Capture. This could not have come at a better time as the Premier and his cabal attempt to muddy the waters by ordering forensic audits and calling people before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) in an attempt to get the spotlight off himself and his role in the collapse of the North West. Just before his State of the Province Address, we said Mahumapelo is like a cat on a hot tin roof trying to find scapegoats instead of taking responsibility. The investigations must not be limited to the Premier only but the Hawks must swoop in on all those who supported and protected the Premier during his terms in office. The raids this morning are a step in the right direction. We will not rest until corrupt politicians and officials swap their luxury suits for prison overalls. Instead of jets and luxury cars, it would be justice if they can be transported at the back of police vehicles with burgular bars. The country’s crime-fighting bodies must push ahead to ensure that all those implicated in stealing from the people of South Africa are investigated and held accountable. It is time for a new beginning with Total Change where the people of North West are served by a caring and corrupt-free government. Issued by Joe McGluwa, DA North West Provincial Leader, 8 March 2018
