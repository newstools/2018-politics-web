Arrest made in illegal occupation of property 28 March 2018 On Monday, an arrest was made against an illegal occupant of a building (Ms Busisiwe Sikhontho). The owners of the building (Mr and Mrs Stols in Malvern, Johannesburg) evicted the suspect after she occupied the house, alleging that she was the owner. She went as far as locking all the gates with chains and locks, denying the owner access to the property.  It was clear that she was not staying with tenants in the house as all the other rooms were empty. The owners of the property were accompanied by law enforcement officials where locks were changed, security measures put in place and the property returned to them. It is unacceptable that criminal elements continue to prevail in the City in this way. The rule of law remains the bedrock for ensuring that we continue to protect the Constitutional rights of members of our communities. Criminals must know that they might run but there is no place for them to hide.  I won’t leave any stone unturned in dealing with criminal activities within its area of jurisdiction. I intend to continue intensifying the raids at these bad and hijacked properties with the assistance of the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies. I would like to encourage people with hijacked properties to please come forward and report by visiting the City’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service offices situated at 48 Ameshoff Street, Braamfontein.
