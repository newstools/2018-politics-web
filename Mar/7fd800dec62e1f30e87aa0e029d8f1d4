Crystal Park High School: Corporal punishment has no place in schools 15 March 2018 Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi must investigate and take stern measures against the deputy principal of Crystal Park High School in Benoni for hitting learners with a stick. A video went viral on social media where the acting principal can be seen hitting the learners. It is alleged that the incident happened on 12 March, when about 40 learners bunked classes and went to the playground where they were caught by the acting principal. Corporal punishment has been banned in schools. The fact that the learners were in the wrong does not give the deputy principal the right to use corporal punishment. The DA strongly condemns the use of corporal punishment in schools. We urge all teachers to refrain from corporal punishment as is illegal. We cannot allow teachers and principals to disregard the law and perpetuate a cycle of abuse MEC Lesufi must continue to engage teachers to avoid corporal punishment as a form of discipline.
