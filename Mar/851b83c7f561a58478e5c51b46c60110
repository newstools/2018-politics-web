Former SARS officials under fire Some 18 months ago NDPP Shaun Abrahams and the National Prosecuting Authority suffered a public humiliation when their highly-publicised charges against certain former SARS officials and Minister Pravin Gordhan had to be abandoned. They were faced with clear refuting evidence of which they were (or ought to have been) aware. KPMG has since repudiated its so-called “forensic report” on which the allegations were largely based. Now, once again, the NPA, urged on by SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane, has seen fit to revive the “rogue unit” fable, levelling charges linked to the unit dating back to 2007/8. Freedom Under Law is convinced that the current allegations are as groundless as those of 2016 and will suffer the same fate. FUL notes with concern that, although Ivan Pillay and Johann van Loggerenberg have throughout been able and willing to co-operate, these brand-new charges have been presented without any enquiry, forewarning or opportunity to make representations. This is in such contrast to the courtesies accorded others that there is every reason to question the motive behind these renewed allegations. Freedom Under Law is consequently writing to the President urging him to consider suspending Adv Abrahams and his senior colleagues Dr Torie Pretorius and Adv Sibongile Mzinyathi forthwith.
