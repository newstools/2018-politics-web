ANC condemns manhandling of journalist on Parliament precinct 20 March 2018 The Office of the ANC Chief Whip strongly condemns the violent behaviour of EFF Chief Whip, Mr Floyd Shivambu and two other unidentified men, who manhandled a journalist on the Parliament precinct this morning. An online video circulating shows Netwerk24 journalist, Adrian de Kock, taking pictures of Mr Shivambu as he was walking towards the Old Assembly Building and, while asking for comment, Mr Shivambu violently grabbed his camera and proceeded to push him against a wall with the assistance of the two unidentified men. It is very regrettable and completely unacceptable that a member of Parliament who also happens to be a Chief Whip of a party, can be found to be involved in such unbecoming behaviour. As parliamentarians, we must at all times be the custodians of our Constitution and our democracy, especially media freedom and freedom of expression. Any journalist working on the parliamentary precinct must be allowed to do their job without any fear of victimisation or hindrance to their work. We call on the Speaker of Parliament to thoroughly investigate this incident and impose the appropriate sanction for such unbecoming behaviour.
