SAP internal probe findings do not absolve them from wrongdoing 8 March 2018 The DA welcomes that the global software giant, SAP’s, internal investigation has found possible breaches in compliance practices and "indications of misconduct"pertaining to business contracts which involved the Guptas, Eskom and Transnet. SAP has admitted that, although it did not pay monies to government officials or employees at state-owned entities, it had paid Gupta-linked intermediary companies over R90 million. These findings are a welcome sign of accountability but do not absolve SAP from wrongdoing. Last year, the DA laid charges of money laundering and corruption following allegations of R100 million in kickbacks changing hands between SAP and CAD House, a Gupta linked company. The DA is of the belief that SAP seemingly tried to use the Guptas’ close connections within parastatals with a view to securing lucrative government contracts. It’s simply not enough that these findings are made public, they must be acted on. Given SAP’s admission of misconduct, they have a responsibility to cooperate with local and international authorities to ensure that those who had a hand in these dodgy dealings are held accountable and face criminal charges, including Minister Malusi Gigaba, who was the Public Enterprises Minister at the time.
