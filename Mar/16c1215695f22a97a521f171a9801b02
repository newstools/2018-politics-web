MEC Lesufi shields SADTU at the expense of learners 13 March 2018 It is unacceptable that the Gauteng Department of Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi has opted to side with the South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) at the expense of our poor learners who are desperate to be taught. Despite the reality that SADTU are holding meetings during school hours and disrupting teaching and learning, the MEC is painting a different picture on the matter and denies the truth. The MEC says the Department has an agreement with the unions that meetings must be held after school hours to avoid disrupting learning and teaching. He added that union meetings can only be held during school hours if there is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed and the school principal must first give approval for the meeting to take place. The time lost must also be recovered through either morning, afternoon or weekend classes. However, this is not always the case as l have visited many schools across the province and have observed on several occasions how SADTU meetings disrupt schooling. The fact that SADTU is the largest teacher union in Gauteng, does not give them the right ignore the rules. SADTU plays a massive role in the ANC’s mobilisation efforts during elections and the ANC would rather sacrifice the future of our learners for the sake of votes. The DA demands that the Department implement’s a better management system to monitor teacher’s attendance and take a firm stance against unions holding meetings during school hours. The ANC and Lesufi cannot be trusted with the futures of Gauteng’s youth. A Total Change in government led by the DA is needed, where quality education is the order of the day and learners come first.
