EFF CALLS ON ALL FIGHTERS AND SOUTH AFRICANS TO HELP PICK N PAY STORES TO REMOVE LISTERIOSIS PRODUCTS FROM SHELVES Wednesday, March 7, 2018 The EFF calls on all fighters and all fellow South Africans to visit nearby outlets of Pick n Pay to help them remove all products that have been declared to spread listeriosis from their shelves. These are the Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken products, including polony, viennas and frankfurters (a.k.a russians) amongst others. It is a matter of fact that Pick n Pay, due to its arrogance and refusal to take responsibility, is failing to act on this with the necessary speed required to save lives. This must apply to all other retail stores, like Shoprite, Woolworths and others. Fighters across the country, together with all South Africans, must help managers and staff of these retail stores to remove listeriosis products from our shelves. The South African outbreak of Listeriosis has been confirmed by the World Health Organisation as the largest incident of listeriosis in history, killing 180 lives, with 980 falling sick. If the government and all related companies will not declare a state of crisis; we must as citizens take it upon ourselves to do so. Thus, the EFF declares the listeriosis outbreak as a crisis and call on all citizens to embark on ensuring all products related to this outbreak are removed from shelves across the country.  No manager or staffer in any of the retail stores must stop citizens from helping in the removal of these products. Finally, we call on Pick n Pay to refund all customers returning their products, even without receipts. It is very clear that no one would keep a receipt if they did not intend on returning the product -  it is only noble to accept this to be the case, and refund customers.
