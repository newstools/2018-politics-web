ANC government failing to ensure safety of learners 14 March 2018 It is an absolute disgrace that a police officer who is mandated by the Constitution to prevent, combat and investigate crime is accused of molesting two pupils at AB Xuma Primary School in Soweto. It is alleged that the police officer, a forensic investigator, sexually abused two pupils when he visited the school to prepare them for court. These two victims are part of the 87 pupils who were allegedly sexually assaulted by a patroller at the school. They have now suffered sexually abuse twice at the hands of the people that they entrusted with their lives. This police officer has violated his oath of office as well as ruined the image of SAPS. The DA condemns in the strongest terms the disgusting behaviour displayed by this sexual predator. He must be banned from working with children and should be registered as a sexual offender. Our children are not safe. They are threatened in society and they are threatened by the authorities meant to protect them. There is an urgent need to restore respect in our society and the protection of human rights. Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi exclaimed in an opinion piece that solving and preventing sexual abuse of learners in schools is as easy as three simple steps. Unfortunately MEC Lesufi does not grasp the severity of the problem as has been highlighted by this second case of abuse. We demand to know who watches the Watchmen in our society. The DA demands a speedy investigation into the matter, and if found guilty, the accused must face the full might of the law. We will write to MEC Lesufi as well as Community Safety MEC, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane to determine what measures will be put in place to prevent incidents such as these from taking place in future.
