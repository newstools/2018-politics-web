DA opposes R10 bank charges for social grants beneficiaries 29 March 2018 The DA is concerned about SASSA’s revelations in Parliament yesterday that beneficiaries who receive their grants through ATMs will have to pay R10 in bank charges from 1 April 2018. These charges will affect 5.4 million beneficiaries, who are among the poorest and vulnerable in our society. These bank charges are due to SASSA not having a contract in place with Grindrod Bank. As a result, the Bank will deduct R10 in bank charges in order to maintain its accounts with SASSA. The reality is that for the millions of South Africans who live in poverty, a R10 makes a huge difference. It is unfair that the poor have to suffer because of the chronic mismanagement, poor planning and instability at SASSA. The truth is that if SASSA had its house in order the payment of social grants would have run smoothly. Instead, we have a situation where there are constant chaos and confusion and a clear lack of decisive leadership. This reiterates the DA's calls that an urgent Parliamentary Inquiry has to be instituted into the governance issues at the agency. The chaos at SASSA can only be blamed on former Social Development Minister, Bathabile Dlamini, who constantly meddled in the affairs of the agency. The DA will continue to push for a Parliamentary Inquiry into SASSA, as it is evident that her replacement, Minister Susan Shabangu, does not have the political will to restore good governance practices at SASSA.
