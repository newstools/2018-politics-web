EFF CELEBRATES THE 61ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF GHANA Tuesday, March 6, 2018 The EFF joins the African continent in the celebration of the 61st Anniversary of the independence of Ghana. The year 1957 will always represent the inauguration of African political freedom characterised by self-determination. In this regard, we remember the founding father of Ghanaians on this crucial day of Pan-African determination, Kwame Nkrumah who defined Ghanian freedom and independence to be incomplete until the entire continent is decolonized. On this occasion, in memory of Nkrumah and in marking the 61st Anniversary of Ghanian Independence, we call on Morocco to end its criminal occupation of Western Sahara. We further call on the African Union to reverse its reactionary decision to accept Morocco into the African family of states whilst it acts as a coloniser over Western Sahara. The EFF wishes the people of Ghana well, and call on them to join in the wave of economic freedom in our lifetime. Indeed, 61 years later, the majority of the people of the continent remain in underdevelopment, poverty, and hunger. These challenges must be confronted through an uncompromising program of economic freedom in our lifetime to complete the genuine decolonisation that was initiated by Ghanaians 61 years ago. We call on the land and mineral resources of the continent to be redirected to benefit African people and their economies. We call on financial institutions like Banks to be nationalised and forced to invest in the economic activities of native peoples of the continent. Finally, we wish President Nana Akufo-Addo who is presiding over Ghana today a long life. We wish him strength in this important chapter of freedom in our continent; that there must be economic freedom in his lifetime for all the people of Ghana and the content.
