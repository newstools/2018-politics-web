Sentence imposed on Vicki Momberg confirms double standards in South Africa regarding race 28 March 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum considers the two-year prison sentence imposed on Vicki Momberg as a reaffirmation of the double standards in South Africa, especially regarding race. Momberg, an unknown estate agent with no political influence, was found guilty on four charges of crimen injuria by virtue of racist remarks which she made toward black people in 2016. This sentence is imposed a few days after a Major in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was simply reprimanded after he said that white people’s eyes and tongues must be stabbed out. AfriForum also this past year submitted 113 criminal charges against people who publicly incited murder, rape, assault and even genocide against white people. Up until now, no significant progress has been made with these cases. However, only a few days after Julius Malema, Leader of the EFF, made remarks in the public regarding the genocide of white people, Pres. Cyril Ramaphosa said that he would welcome back Malema in the governing ANC. Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum, says that Momberg’s remarks were indeed racist and need to be condemned. “However, the inconsistency being applied in this country regarding minorities has reached the level of absurdity. The reality in South Africa is thus that a white person who insults a black person goes to prison, while a senior officer in the Defence Force who says that white people’s eyes and tongues must be stabbed out is simply asked nicely not to repeat it. In addition, an influential political leader talking about genocide is rewarded with an invitation to join the ruling party.” Issued by Natasha Venter, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 28 March 2018
