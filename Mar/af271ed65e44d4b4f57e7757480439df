109 farm attacks in less than 100 days of 2018 19 March 2018 AfriForum today announced that 2018 has already witnessed about 109 farm attacks and about 15 farm murders in South Africa. “Our rural areas are trapped in a crime war,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Safety. “Although the South African government denies that a violence crisis is staring rural areas in the face, the numbers prove that excessive violence plague these areas.” Cameron adds that torturing with irons, blow-torches, melted plastic and boiling water often continues for hours during these attacks. He also says that there is a significant increase in these types of attacks in the Northern and Western Cape. “Government cannot deny the facts – our people are being mowed down,” Cameron says.
