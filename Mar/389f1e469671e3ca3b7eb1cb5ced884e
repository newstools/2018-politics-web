The Nelson Mandela Foundation welcomes judgement on Momberg The Nelson Mandela Foundation has taken note of the prison sentence given to Ms Vicky Momberg. It delivers a clear message to South Africans that the kind of race-based abuse for which Ms Momberg was found guilty will not be tolerated. For too long post-apartheid South Africa has pursued what we would call strategies of generosity in relation to such manifestations of racism. It must stop. But it is not enough to act against ‘incidents’ of racism. It is time to transform the underlying structures of power and privilege. Statement issued by Lunga Nene, Nelson Mandela Foundation, 28 March 2018
