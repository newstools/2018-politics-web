The decision to cover Zuma’s legal fees should be declared invalid The DA has today filed papers with the North Gauteng High Court asking the court to declare that the agreement between the Presidency and Jacob Zuma, to cover the legal costs incurred by him for his criminal prosecution be reviewed, declared invalid and set aside. We are further asking that the court order that the R15.3 million already spent on the litigation be refunded. We base this on the fact that the State Attorney Act refers specifically to covering legal costs due to actions committed while an employee of the State and in the course of duty. Not one of the charges against Zuma relates to his actions committed when he was an MEC, Deputy President or President. Therefore, it is our view that Zuma must payback the R15.3 million already spent in litigation that has stretched over the better part of a decade in which Zuma did his utmost to avoid his day in court, at the public’s expense. He should not be given a single cent more for criminal trial which is yet to begin. These expenses must be covered by Zuma personally. The DA looks forward to confirmation of the trial date where Zuma will finally face the 783 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering against him. Zuma has already cost our country dearly. All money spent thus far for his delaying tactics must be recovered and South Africans should not have to pay a single cent towards defending him in the criminal case.
