GDP in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 3,1% Gross domestic product (measured by production) South Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 3,1% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The largest positive contributor to growth in GDP in the fourth quarter was the agriculture, forestry and fishing industry, which increased by 37,5% and contributed 0,8 of a percentage point to GDP growth. The trade, catering and accommodation industry increased by 4,8% and contributed 0,6 of a percentage point to GDP growth. The manufacturing industry and finance, real estate and business services increased by 4,3% and 2,5% respectively, and each contributed 0,5 of a percentage point to GDP growth. Notable increases were reported by the following manufacturing divisions: food and beverages; petroleum, chemical products, rubber and plastic products; and basic iron and steel, non-ferrous metal products, metal products and machinery. The mining and quarrying industry decreased by 4,4% and contributed -0,3 of a percentage point to GDP growth. This was largely the result of lower production in gold and platinum group metals. Expenditure on GDP2 Expenditure on real gross domestic product increased 3,1% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Household final consumption expenditure increased by 3,6% in the fourth quarter, contributing 2,2 percentage points to total growth. The main positive contributors to growth in HFCE were expenditure on clothing and footwear (20,7% and contributing 1,1 percentage points), household furnishings and equipment (10,8% and contributing 0,9 of a percentage point), food and non-alcoholic beverages (3,4% and contributing 0,6 of a percentage point), and expenditure on transport (4,1% and contributing 0,6 of a percentage point). Final consumption expenditure by general government increased by 1,6%. Gross fixed capital formation increased by 7,4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The largest contributor to growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was machinery and other equipment3, which increased by 9,2% and contributed 3,0 percentage points to growth in GFCF. Transport equipment increased by 21,7% and contributed 2,3 percentage points. 2 There was a build-up of inventories of R11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Large inventory build-up was reported for the trade sector. Net exports contributed -3,7 percentage points to total growth. Exports increased by 12,3%, mainly because of higher exports of base metals and precious metals products. Imports increased by 26,5%, mainly due to higher imports of machinery and equipment. Key findings for annual estimates 2017 Real annual GDP (measured by production) increased by 1,3% in 2017 following an increase of 0,6% in 2016 According to the latest preliminary indicators, the annual real estimate of GDP for 2017 increased by 1,3% following an increase of 0,6% in 2016. The annual real GDP growth of 1,3% in 2017 was primarily led by increased economic activity by finance, real estate and business services, which contributed 0,4 of a percentage point based on growth of 1,9%; agriculture, forestry and fishing, which contributed 0,4 of a percentage point based on growth of 17,7%; and mining and quarrying, which contributed 0,3 of a percentage point based on growth of 4,6%. The declines were led by the trade sector, which decreased by 0,6% in 2017, followed by a decline of 0,3% in the construction industry. Expenditure on GDP in 2017 Expenditure on GDP increased by 1,2% in 2017, accelerating from an increase of 0,6% in 2016. Household consumption increased by 2,2% and contributed 1,4 percentage points, while government consumption increased by 0,6% and contributed 0,1 of a percentage point. The main positive contributors to growth of 2,2 % in HFCE were expenditure on the ‘other’ category (5,8% and contributing 0,7 of a percentage point), household furnishings and equipment (6,6% and contributing 0,5 of a percentage point) and health services (4,2% and contributing 0,3 of a percentage point). Gross fixed capital formation increased by 0,4%, contributing 0,1 of a percentage point to total growth, and the change in inventories contributed 0,2 of a percentage point. Net exports contributed -0,6 of a percentage point to growth in expenditure on GDP. Footnotes: 1 Unless otherwise specified, quarter-on-quarter growth rates are seasonally adjusted and annualised.
