DA welcomes Esidimeni judgement, justice prevails 19 March 2018 The DA welcomes former Deputy Justice Dikgang Moseneke's award today of R1.2 million to 146 claimants arising from the death and maltreatment of Life Esidimeni patients. Justice Moseneke's rewards are a stinging rebuke to the Gauteng provincial government which only offered R200 000 damages under common law and denied that it was liable for breaches of constitutional rights. The amount to be paid to the claimants is about R175 million in total, which is way more than the R28 million currently budgeted in the current provincial budget in this matter. It is shameful that the provincial government sought to restrict the legitimate claims of relatives of those who died. Justice Moseneke made clear findings about criminal liability concerning former MEC Qedani Mahlangu and senior officials and the police must follow up on the evidence presented at the arbitration hearings. Total expenses for the provincial government are likely to be a lot more than R200 million as a monument to the deceased has to be built and there are other expenses of the arbitration to be paid. Justice Moseneke has demonstrated great wisdom and compassion and set a binding precedent for the dignified treatment of all people in line with the Constitution.
