Resignation of suspended Eskom Group Executive for Information Technology, Mr Sean Maritz 1 March 2018 Eskom has today received a resignation letter from suspended Group Executive for Information Technology, Mr Sean Maritz, stating that he has decided to resign with immediate effect. Mr Maritz’s resignation comes against the backdrop of serious charges of misconduct that were levelled against him, that would have been adjudicated at his disciplinary hearing scheduled for 8 - 9 March 2018. The disciplinary process to hold Mr Maritz to account for any proven wrongdoing can no longer be pursued in light of clear legal precedent that a resignation by an employee unilaterally terminates the employment relationship. Eskom has, as a result, accepted Mr Maritz’s resignation with immediate effect. However, Eskom reserves all its rights to institute legal action in respect of any damages that the company may have suffered arising from his actions at Eskom, and to enforce its legal rights under the Pension Funds Act. The Board of Eskom remains committed to its mandate to root out malfeasance and maladministration as a critical foundation to restoring transparent and effective governance. As indicated during the interim results presentation, a key focus for the new Board has been to address governance-related issues as a matter of urgency. Issued by Eskom, 1 March 2018
