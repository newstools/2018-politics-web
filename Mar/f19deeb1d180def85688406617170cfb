People of Johannesburg are ready to reclaim the City 1 March 2018 The African National Congress welcomes the results of the by-elections held in two (2) provinces on yesterday, 28 February 2018. Contested wards were Ward 14, City of Johannesburg, in Gauteng and Ward 20, Mafikeng, in North West. The voters were unambiguous in their support for their movement. The ANC retained both wards with increased vote percentages as compared to the 2016 Local Government Elections results. The landslide victory in Ward 14, City of Johannesburg, is an indication of the people's rejection of the DA led municipality and an affirmation of their continued support and confidence in the people's movement, the ANC. The people of Johannesburg are ready to reclaim the City of Johannesburg. Such support and confidence of the people in the ANC is also demonstrated with the victory in Ward 20, Mafikeng, North West Province. We are humbled by such support and confidence. We do not take it for granted. The ANC congratulates the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) for, once again, delivering the credible, free and fair elections. We thank all members, supporters and volunteers of the ANC for their selfless work ahead of the elections. Issued by Pule Mabe, National Spokesperson, ANC, 1 March 2018
