DA welcomes Vicki Momberg sentencing 28 March 2018 The DA welcomes the landmark ruling sentencing Vicki Momberg to a three-year imprisonment following her conviction on four counts of crimen injuria for racist remarks made towards a black police officer. This ruling follows a video which emerged where Momberg could be seen shouting racial insults and slurs at the police officer who was assisting her after she herself was allegedly a victim of a smash and grab. We trust that this ruling will be a deterrent to those who may harbour any racist sentiments. The court has affirmed that racism goes against the principles of constitutional democracy and this decision should therefore be welcomed by all. Racism has no place in our democracy and those found guilty of racism and racist acts must face the consequences. As South Africa’s most diverse political organisation, the DA holds that there is no room for racists in our country and we will continue to work together with South Africans from all walks of life to ensure that we build a truly non-racial society. We will not tolerate any form of discrimination from any individual irrespective of their race. Issued by Refiloe Nt'sekhe, DA National Spokesperson, 28 March 2018
