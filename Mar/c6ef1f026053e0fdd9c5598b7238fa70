RESPONSE TO ARMAND GREYLING “SOUTH GAUTENG LAND CLAIM IS WITH MERIT” Bakwena ba Mare a Phogole lodged their land claim in 1995, despite having to wait for a long time to get our claim processed like all other claims, we never resorted to cheap politicking nor misleading of the general public. In 2012, Two court orders by consent with the land claims commission were achieved before Honourable Judge Lootz – these court orders dealt with evidence of the claim from both parties including the conducting of the inspection in loco. The RLCC then requested to have an independent mediator to verify facts and the evidence provided, the mediator report was completed and submitted to both parties. The mediator report was in favour of Bakwena Ba Mare a Phogole and directed the Commission to note that “Justice Delayed is Justice Denied” After a long protracted battle with the commission, a court order by consent was reached in January 2014 before Hon Judge Mpshe and the commission agreed that the land claim of Bakwena ba Mare a Phogole is VALID and compliant with the requirement of restitution land rights act22 OF 1994. A further court order by Hon Judge Rajab-Budlender AJ was achieved in October 2016, of which it was in favour of Bakwena Ba Mare a Phogole We therefore call upon Armand Greyling, Afribusiness, Afriforum and their counterpart RLCC, to stop peddling lies and misleading the public and before they run to publish stories, they must get their facts correct, misleading the public and creating panic is not in consistent with the law that guides land claims and restitution Bakwena Ba Mare a Phogole are a community that respects the rule of law and we do all means possible to follow the law, we are not in any way attempting to set aside the 90 day period that was illegally extended – we have already dealt with the comments and submission of the first 60 days as well as the illegally extended 90 day period. ARMAND GREYLING, STOP PEDDLING LIES AND MISLEADING THE PUBLIC, GET YOUR FACTS CORRECT.
