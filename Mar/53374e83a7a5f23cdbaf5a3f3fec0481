CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA SASSA and another v Minister of Social Development and others CCT 48/17 Date of Judgment: 23 March 2018 ________________________________________________________________________ MEDIA SUMMARY ________________________________________________________________________ The following explanatory note is provided to assist the media in reporting this case and is not binding on the Constitutional Court or any member of the Court. Today the Constitutional Court handed down an order, with reasons to follow, regarding an urgent interlocutory application which had been brought by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) and the Chief Executive Officer of SASSA (the applicants). The applicants sought a suspension of a declaration of invalidity, which had been granted by this Court on 17 March 2017, for a period of 12 months. The applicants asked for the 12 month period to be extended for an additional 6 months. The extension, followed on from the original order of this Court granted on 17 April 2014 which had found that the contract between Cash Paymaster Services (Pty) Ltd (CPS) and SASSA was constitutionally invalid. This application differed from the suspension of the declaration of invalidity granted on 17 March 2017 for a period of 12 months in that, SASSA requested an extension of the declaration of invalidity in respect of payment services to only those social grant beneficiaries who receive their social grants through cash payments. This Court made an order granting the extension of the declaration of invalidity for a further period of 6 months from 1 April 2018, in respect of payments of social grants, in the form of cash payments only. The Court further ordered that SASSA and CPS remain under a constitutional obligation to ensure payment of social grants to grant beneficiaries, whose grants are paid in cash for the period of the extension. Such payments are to be made on the same terms and conditions as those in the contract between SASSA and CPS that would have become invalid on 31 March 2018. The Court has also maintained its supervisory jurisdiction over the matter and continues to require the Minster of Social Development (Minister) and SASSA to file reports, on a monthly basis, setting out the steps that these parties have taken in ensuring that they are meeting their constitutional obligations in providing social grants to beneficiaries who receive such services through cash payments. Further, the Minister and SASSA are under an obligation to immediately report to this Court of any material changes relating to the reports filed with this Court. In regard to the payment method which will be adopted by SASSA for the provision of cash payments, SASSA is under an obligation to ensure that all personal data of beneficiaries obtained through the process remains private. It is further ordered that any contracting party employed by SASSA in relation to such a process may not invite beneficiaries to “opt in” to sharing confidential information for the marketing of goods or services. CPS may, during the six month period, request that National Treasury undertake an investigation and make a recommendation regarding the price to be paid for the services CPS is to render in terms of services rendered during this extension. National Treasury will have to file a report with this Court 21 days after receipt of the request setting out its recommendations. CPS will be required to file with this Court, within 30 days of completion of the contract, an audited statement of the expenses incurred, the income received and the net profit earned over the extension. SASSA will immediately thereafter be required to obtain an independent verification of the audited financial statement of CPS. This audited verification must be approved by National Treasury and filed by SASSA with this Court within 60 days. CPS must allow the auditors of SASSA to have unfettered access to financial information for this purpose. The Court further continues to mandate the Panel of Experts (Expert Panel)to evaluate the implementation of the cash payment of social grants during the six month period and evaluate the steps taken by SASSA in the appointment of a new contractor for cash payment of social grants, and to report to this Court. The Expert Panel is to report to the Court on its findings on a monthly basis. The Court has further ordered that the former Minister of Social Development Ms Bathabile Dlamini and the acting Chief Executive Officer of SASSA, Ms Pearl Bhengu should file affidavits giving reasons why they should not be joined in these proceedings in their personal capacities and should not be held personally liable to pay all or a portion of the legal costs in this matter.
