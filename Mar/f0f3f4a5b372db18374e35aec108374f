Ramaphosa in the dark about the reality of land grabs 12 March 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa says that land grabs will not be tolerated and that the law will be strictly enforced in this regard. And yet, the reality is that land grabs are indeed taking place while law enforcers are looking on and not taking action against those breaking the law. The police do not listen and respond to landowners’ requests to step in and take action against land invaders. The police and metro police are just standing by and looking on while laws are violated and insist on a court order before they are prepared to act. Pres. Ramaphosa will have to make sure that his words are followed by appropriate action as not everyone has the money to first get a court order to ‘activate’ the police to take the necessary steps. Land grabs are taking place across the country and between Groblersdal and Marble Hall, land grabbers have broken up a tar road in order to block access routes. Thus far, no arrests have been made in this regard and land grabbers are apparently going unpunished. The president will have to face up to the reality of what is happening on grassroots level and he will have to take note of the fact that unrealistic expectations regarding land were created among the masses. Ramaphosa will only pass the test if law enforcers take immediate action when complaints against land invaders and illegal occupants are lodged.
