South Africa should join hands against racists like Andile Mngxitama of the BLF 11 December 2018 The inflammatory hate speech of Andile Mngxitama of Black First Land First (BLF) on 8 December during a meeting in Potchefstroom where he incited his followers to murder whites should be regarded in a very serious light. According to Mr Louis Meintjes of TAU SA. South Africa is currently experiencing a very unstable period during which such utterances cannot be tolerated. TAU SA has laid a charge against him and this will be a test to see what action is to be taken. A wave of farm attacks and murder is currently experienced and it is quite possible that Mngxitama’s inflammatory utterances will contribute to making matters worse. In previous incidents where whites were regarded as making derogatory remarks, rapid and strong action was forthcoming, said Mr Meintjes. It is impossible to build for the future as long as people like Mngxitama are allowed to walk freely whilst inciting people to commit murder. He belongs in jail, said Mr Meintjes. The public is requested to visit www.stopblf.com, provide the requested information and in doing that, send an outomated e-mail to President Cyril Ramaphosa, the Minister of Police, the national Police Commissioner and the National Prosecuting Authority to immediately act against the BLF and its leader Andile Mngxitama, to arrest him and to sentence him with the maximum sentence for inciting violence and racial hatred.
