ANC notes the court judgment on the former president's legal costs 14 December 2018 The African National Congress (ANC) has noted the judgement by North Gauteng High Court that former President Jacob Zuma pay his legal costs on the criminal charges he is facing. We also noted that the state attorney has been asked by the court to compile a list of the full costs incurred on the former President’s cases. As the ANC, affirm our commitment to the rule of law and the justice system of our country. The contribution of Cde Jacob Zuma towards the liberation of South Africa will not be forgotten, and therefore, there may be South Africans who wish to assist him with these huge legal costs. The ANC shall not discourage any South African who wishes to do so.  As the ANC we shall always respect the sacrifice and contribution of former President Zuma. We have noted a social media banner in ANC colours purporting to be raising funds to pay legal costs on behalf of the former President.  The ANC contacted Cde Zuma who has no knowledge of this. The ANC cautions South Africans to be wary of con and scam artists who want to exploit the name of the former President for nefarious objectives. The ANC will look at the judgement more closely and will comment further if necessary. Issued by Zizi Kodwa, Acting National Spokesperson, ANC, 14 December 2018
