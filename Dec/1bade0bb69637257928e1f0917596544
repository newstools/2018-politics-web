Power crisis: It is time for Eskom to play open cards The DA notes conflicting reports surrounding the current crisis at Eskom and believes that South Africans deserve clarity with regards to the many theories, explanations and excuses provided by Eskom during these very dark days. There are many reasons for the power failures South Africans are now being forced to endure – ranging from State Capture and a lack of coal to allegations of irregular tenders and Eskom’s use of companies that are unable to provide the services Eskom so desperately needs. For the sake of clarity and transparency the DA calls on Eskom to provide a list of all the companies it has taken action against with regards to incorrect tender processes. We also call on Eskom to inform South Africans whether it has applied for any urgent interdicts to stop contracts which result in coal shortages. The underlying problem, regardless of the current crisis, is that the structure of Eskom inevitably needs to change. Eskom has proven it is incapable of delivering power to South Africans within its current operational model, and it has proven so, time and again in many different ways: -  Eskom recently failed to communicate clearly with PetroSA, a simple mechanism which could have alleviated the degree of load-shedding we are currently experiencing; -  Money for plant maintenance was re-directed towards Gupta-linked firms in 2015, resulting in new and higher upkeep costs in 2018; -  The Eskom wage bill and its other finances are out of control; and -  Poor project management at Medupi and Kusile stations doubled the costs of the building process Eskom is an entity which finds itself in a state of complete collapse and the only thing that can save it is if the entire structure changes. The mess we currently find ourselves in with Eskom is undoubtedly a result of an ANC which has allowed corruption and irregularities to manifest within our state-owned enterprises. South Africans deserve clarity and honesty with regards to this crisis. The ANC’s mismanagement of Eskom needs to end, and South Africans can ensure this at the ballot boxes in 2019, by voting for a party that will ensure all South African homes are filled with warmth and light in the next festive season.
