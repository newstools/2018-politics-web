Mbalula’s Dubai trip: AfriForum welcomes Public Protector’s finding 19 December 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum welcomes the finding of the Public Protector (PP), Busisiwe Mkhwebane, that the 2016 family holiday trip to Dubai of former Minister of Sport, Fikile Mbalula, was paid for by Sedgars Sports and that this constitutes a conflict of interest.The PP has also found that Mbalula acted in violation of the Constitution and the Executive Ethics Code. The case has now be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to further investigate whether the funds used to pay for Mbalula’s trip were not proceeds of money laundering. “We urge the NPA to consider whether this conduct does not constitute corruption as defined in the recent judgement of the Supreme Court of Appeal, S versus Scholtz and Others,” says Monique Taute, Head of AfriForum’s Anticorruption Unit. AfriForum directed a written request to the PP on 9 October 2017 to launch an investigation into the alleged payment of at least R300 000 and possibly as much as R680 000 by Sedgars Sports, a sporting goods supplier, for Mbalula’s trip to Dubai with his family. “AfriForum will monitor the process and should the NPA fail to do their job and not prosecute of their own accord, Adv. Gerrie Nel and our Private Prosecution Unit will privately prosecute Mbalula to ensure that justice prevails,” concludes Taute.
