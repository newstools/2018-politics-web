Court granted interdict to temporarily suspend NSF promotions 20 December 2018 The High Court today granted an interdict in Solidarity’s favour to temporarily put a stop to the promotions of former MK and APLA members, the so-called non-statutory forces (NSF), in the SA Police Service (SAPS). This followed after Solidarity brought an urgent application before the High Court for an interdict to stop the promotions of approximately 628 NSF members until the court heard arguments on the validity and legality of the NSF Project as a whole on 30 January next year. According to Renate Barnard, Sector Coordinator of Special Projects at Solidarity, this verdict is a victory for the other 150 000 loyal members of the SAPS whose opportunities for promotion are being hampered by the NSF Project. “Solidarity strongly argues that the promotion of NSF members – who in some cases jump as many as five ranks – is extremely unlawful and unconstitutional. In addition, these unconstitutional promotions will result in other members of the police with years of faithful service not being promoted, solely because they do not have a certain background. Therefore, we are overjoyed that the court found that the promotions may not take place until the legality of the whole project has been tested,” Barnard said. According to Barnard, Solidarity is looking forward to the thorough review of the NSF promotions by the court early next year. “It is in the interests of our members and in national interest that the NSF Project be reviewed. It is nothing but a politically motivated project,” Barnard said. Court order attached. Click hereIssued by Renate Barnard, Sector Coordinator: Special Projects, Solidarity, 20 December 2018
