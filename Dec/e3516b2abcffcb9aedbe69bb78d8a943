Marotola Primary School 6. Nokuthula Special School (LSEN school) (ii) Please see (i) above. (b) The Department has a backlog in relation to the new and replacement schools, that is perpetuated by the constant influx of learners into the province. The Department has not achieved all its targets related to building schools, as indicated in (a) above, due to a number of reasons that have had an adverse impact on the delivery of schools. These include but not limited to: - Budgetary Constraints; - Under perfomance by contractors; - Community disruptions; and - Inclement weather. 2. The Department will not be forcing but engaging and encouraging the existing single-medium schools that have received a sufficiently large number of learner applications for admission, to offer additional languages and thereby become dual-medium schools. It must be noted that the process is guided by, amongst others, the number of applications to a school. Issued by Parliament, 14 December 2018
