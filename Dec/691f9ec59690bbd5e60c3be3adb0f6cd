Attacks on our police are an attack on residents 20 December 2018 Attacks on members of the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Departments (JMPD) are completely intolerable. These brave men and women serve at the forefront of the fight against crime; the fight to protect the residents of the City of Johannesburg. I wonder, what type of society will we have without our police? I am therefore shocked and angered by the attack on Officer Zintle Nkqonkqoza last night, 19 December 2018, during a roadblock in Braamfontein. She was fired at by suspects in a white BMW, who were trying to escape the roadblock. Thankfully, she only suffered a flesh wound on her right shoulder. She was receiving medical treatment at the Milpark Hospital when I paid her a visit this afternoon, along with members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and JMPD Chief of Police, David Tembe. Attacks of this nature are, sadly, not uncommon. Our brave JMPD officers face each day with the possibility of injury. We cannot allow attacks on our police because every attack on the police is, in fact, also an attack on the people of this City. I call on all law enforcement agencies to work together in apprehending the suspects as soon as possible and bring them to justice.
