Andile Mngxitama charged for incitement to violence 11 December 2018 Yesterday, the DA opened a case against BLF leader, Andile Mngxitama, at the SAPS Potchefstroom, for his racially charged calls inciting violence against white South Africans made during a rally he addressed at Ikageng Stadium this past Saturday. The case number is 199/12/2018. Calling on people to join a militia outfit and inciting violence against individuals or groups of South Africans goes against the very grain of our constitutional order. This sort of behaviour seeks only to divide our nation on the basis of race and threatens the gains we have made towards reconciliation and truly building One South Africa for All. Mngxitama’s dangerous rhetoric must be condemned and rejected in the strongest terms, and the relevant authorities have a duty to act against Mngxitama and his pseudo-revolutionary grouping. The DA will not idly stand by and allow those who wish to dump this country back into the darkness of Apartheid to do so unopposed. The SAPS should investigate these charges, which would be an easy exercise to do, as evidence of Mngxitama’s incitement to violence is well documented and in the public domain. Mngxitama should be quickly prosecuted. Yesterday, my colleague, DA National Spokesperson, Solly Malatsi, reported the BLF and Mngxitama to the South African Human Rights Commission, as well as the Equality Court. The DA remains the only party that seeks to bring South Africans from all walks of life together, united in our diversity towards a common goal, we can truly reach our maximum potential, building a society based on freedom, fairness, opportunity and diversity Issued by Joe McGluwa, DA North West Premier Candidate, 11 December 2018
