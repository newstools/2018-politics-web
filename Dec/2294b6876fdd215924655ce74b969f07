Arrests made in Vodacom vandalism case 6 December 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo has been reliablely informed that some arrests have been made with regard to the vandalism that took place at Vodacom’s Mall of North branch. We have also been informed that there will be more arrests to follow in the coming days as the net closes in on these constitutional delinquents. The violent attack on the store was allegedly carried out by the EFF over an image of Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu captioned “abusers of democracy” by a keynote speaker at the Vodacom journalist of the year awards. The DA added charges of malicious damage to property and accessory to a crime against the alleged EFF hooligans that caused damage estimated at R500 000. These arrests are welcomed and are a beginning to quell the inherent thuggery and bullying dished out by the EFF whenever someone expresses a view divergent to theirs. Infringements on the bill of rights as well as crime can never be condoned regardless of whatever agreement or settlement is reached between perpetrator and victim as it is in the public interest. The DA will continue to hold the EFF accountable for these alleged cowardly actions and will not let peace loving South Africans be held ransom by a political party with only 6% of the national vote. We also thank the South African Police Service (SAPS) for their professional conduct in this matter and also hope for the process to conclude without fear or favour. We will continue to monitor developments in this case to ensure justice is carried out and that the culprits are held accountable.
