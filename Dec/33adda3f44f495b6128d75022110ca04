25% of matric subjects still don’t pass the quality test Today’s announcement of matric mark adjustments by Umalusi has again raised questions about the management of the South African National Senior Certificate (NSC) exams. Of the 67 subjects considered for the Department of Basic Education (DBE) matric exams, 17 had their marks adjusted upwards – one more than last year. This means a quarter of all DBE subjects still have their marks adjusted upwards. This continuing trend raises some serious questions. DBE NSC subject adjustments (2012-2018) Year Total subjects Total adjusted Adjusted upwards Adjusted downwards 2012 61 17 4 13 2013 62 15 2 13 2014 58 23 13 10 2015 59 30 29 1 2016 58 32 28 4 2017 58 20 16 4 2018 67 28 17 11 Unfortunately, we have no idea how large these adjustments are. Umalusi hides this information from the public, and refuses to allow elected Members of Parliament to attend the standardisation meeting. Anyone who questions these adjustments is accused of attempting to disrupt the process and attack the school system, simply for asking for clarity. Protecting the quality of the matric certificate is vital to ensuring that young South Africans can study further or secure a job after school. The DA will continue to seek greater transparency so that learners and their parents can feel secure in their matric qualification. The DA congratulates all learners who accepted the challenge of writing the exams, and wishes the matrics all the best for the announcement of the results next week.
