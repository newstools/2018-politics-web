DA welcomes Public Protector findings against Mbalula 19 December 2018 Following a complaint by the DA, the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkwhebane, today confirmed that former Minister of Sport and Recreation, Fikile Mbalula’s, acceptance of a payment from Sedgards Sports for his family’s R680 000 trip to Dubai, was in fact a conflict of interest. Sedgars Sports is contracted to supply clothing for the South African Sports Confederation and Olympics Committee (SASCOC). As Sports Minister, SASCOC was under the purview of Mbalula, which made his acceptance of these monies a clear conflict of interest and a violation of the Constitution and the Executive Members Ethics Code. It is clear that Mbalula abused his position to live a flashy lifestyle. He fancied himself as a celebrity rather than a minister mandated to serve the interest of the people. Furthermore, the DA welcomes the Public Protector referring these findings to the National Prosecuting Authority for investigation. It is crucial that this investigation receives priority and that Mbalula is held accountable for his actions. While the DA has long held that the Public Protector is not fit for office, it is clear that this violation on the part of Mbalula was so obvious that even she could not soft peddle it. Mbalula is typical of the ANC’s brazen penchant for abusing state resources for personal benefit. We have no doubt that even now that the Public Protector has found Mbalula guilty of violating the Constitution, he will continue to lead the party’s election campaign. The ANC has proven itself as an organization which shies away from holding its own to account. This is the message the ANC is taking to South Africa. It is a party of broken promises and will do anything to shield to empower those who have been found guilty of corruption.
