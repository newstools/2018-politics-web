Failing ANC to be blamed for Gauteng water crisis The failing ANC is to be blamed for the looming water crisis in Gauteng. This follows reports that Gauteng is running out of drinking water as its dam levels have dropped drastically. If the failing ANC was serious about ensuring that its citizens have access to adequate water supplies then they should have consistently maintained their water infrastructure. The sewage contamination of the Vaal River is the major contributing factor to this water crisis. Under the ANC's watch, they have allowed sewage from the Emfuleni Local Municipality to flow into the Vaal River despite being warned that it will have a huge impact on water supply in Gauteng. The raw sewage is causing water pollution. The drinking water is now used to flush pollution out of the Vaal River system and, as a result, we are left with a water shortage. Furthermore, the failing ANC-led municipalities in Gauteng namely the Emfuleni Local Municipality, Merafong Local Municipality, Lesedi Local Municipality, and the West Rand District Municipality are facing severe challenges of water leakages yet nothing has been done to fix this problem. Water leakages are also contributing to water losses. Better communication on the state of this water crisis is urgently needed. The Gauteng government must drive an awareness campaign to conscientise its residents to use water wisely. Premier Makhura and the ANC have allowed our water infrastructure to collapse. Come 2019, when the DA governs Gauteng, we will ensure that we maintain our infrastructure to deliver better services to the residents of Gauteng.
