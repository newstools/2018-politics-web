Supra Mahumapelo should immediately pay back the Denel money 6 December 2018 Former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo should immediately pay back the R1.1 million bursary extended to his son, Oarabile, as he himself has committed to do when the DA first raised concerns over the legality of the bursary in the Provincial Legislature. The DA will write to President Cyril Ramaphosa urging him to issue a proclamation to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) to investigate this matter and to have Supra’s assets repossessed and auctioned to recover the money should he fail to willing repay the money. We also take note that Denel in April this year denied that the bursary was awarded illegally, only to seven months later back track and confirm in Parliament that the whole affair was indeed illegal. The DA is not surprised at this instance of corruption. Supra, a former so-called Premier League ANC politician, like his fellow tsotsi comrades Ace Magashule and David Mabuza, is notorious for abusing his office for personal financial and material gain. There is not a more perfect example of the failing ANC’s rent-seeking culture than this illegal bursary that benefitted the son of a Premier at the expense of the people. ANC cadres eat first and leave the scraps for the poor, desperate and the destitute. The time has come to completely reject the failing ANC before there is nothing left to govern. In 2019 change is possible in North West. It is an opportunity to elect a responsive and caring DA government that will work day and night to improve the lives of people through effective, corruption free, governance and improved service delivery that will contribute to building One South Africa for All.
