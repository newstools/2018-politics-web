AfriForum takes Andile Mngxitama to the Equality Court 10 December 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum instructed its legal team to compose court documents to lay a charge of hate speech against Andile Mngxitama, Leader of Black First Land First (BLF), at the Equality Court. In the entreaties AfriForum also requests a finding by the Court that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) must institute an investigation to criminally prosecute Mngxitama. This follows after Mngxitama on 8 December incited the murder on white people during a speech in Potchefstroom. “We’ll kill their children. We’ll kill their women. We’ll kill anything that we find on our way… We’ll kill their dogs. We’ll kill their cats. We’ll kill anything that comes before us,” said Mngxitama among others. He argued that his organisation will murder five white people each time a black person is murdered in South Africa. Mngxitama furthermore argued that his organisation is busy mobilising 50 000 soldiers for this objective. Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum, says that this is blatant hate speech and incitement of violence, and that the organisation will fight it with the necessary earnestness. In the court documents AfriForum furthermore requests that Mngxitama is ordered to pay R500 000 to an organisation which campaigns towards battling hate speech. AfriForum’s court documents ought to be filed at the Equality Court by tomorrow. Issued by Marelie Greeff, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 10 December 2018
