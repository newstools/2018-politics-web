Former Western Cape ANC leader Marius Fransman will face the full might of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), a spokesperson has confirmed. Northern Cape NPA spokesperson Phaladi Shuping told News24 on Saturday that Fransman faces two charges of crimen injuria and sexual assault. The NPA is currently in talks with its provincial branches to centralise the case, as some of the incidents allegedly also took place in the North West and Western Cape. Both Fransman and the complainant, Louisa Wynand, were notified of the decision on Friday. Wynand had asked the police to investigate a case of sexual assault in January 2016 while the ANC was holding celebrations in the North West. A few months later, the ANC's National Disciplinary Committee announced it had found Fransman guilty on two counts of misconduct, and suspended his ANC membership for five years. Wynand's spokesperson Gavin Prins told Sowetan Live she was relieved that the NPA chose to prosecute. Wynand was hoping to move on with her life, Prins said. Attempts to reach Fransman's personal assistant Vanessa Le Roux on Saturday were unsuccessful. News24
