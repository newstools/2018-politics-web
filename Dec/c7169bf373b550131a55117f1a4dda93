President Ramaphosa welcomes judgement on dismissal of Mr Tom Moyane 11 December 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa has welcomed the North Gauteng High Court judgment upholding the President’s dismissal of Mr Tom Moyane as Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (SARS). President Ramaphosa ended Mr Moyane’s tenure at SARS in November 2018 following a recommendation by the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into governance of the Revenue Service and tax administration. Mr Moyane subsequently engaged in litigation to overturn his dismissal, interdict the appointment of a new SARS Commissioner and to prevent the Commission of Inquiry from submitting its final report. The North Gauteng High Court dismissed Mr Moyane’s application with punitive costs today, Tuesday 11 December 2018. President Ramaphosa has welcomed the judgment as a step towards stabilising SARS at a time when efficient revenue collection and tax justice is vital to economic recovery and restoring the confidence of corporate and personal taxpayers in this important public institution. In line with the recommendations of the Nugent Commission, the President will soon initiate the process to appoint a new SARS commissioner.
