FF Plus lodges complaint of hate speech and incitement to violence against Andile Mngxitama 11 December 2018 Earlier today, the FF Plus lodged a complaint of hate speech and incitement to violence as well as incitement to commit an offence, namely murder, with the Potchefstroom Police against Andile Mnxitama, the leader of the Black First Land First (BLF) movement, after he urged supporters in Potchefstroom this past Saturday to kill white people. During the launch of the movement's election campaign for the 2019 elections held at the Ikageng stadium, Mnxitama encouraged his supporters to kill white men, their wives and even their animals. Similar complaints have also been lodged with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) as well as the Equality Court against both Mnxitama and the BLF seeing as the party has not distanced itself from its leader's statements. Furthermore, the FF Plus will request that the BLF be de-registered as a political party in terms of the Electoral Act which prohibits unacceptable behaviour by political parties, such as incitement to violence. Given the current climate of racial polarisation in our country, which the ANC created with its discriminatory legislation and policies like expropriation without compensation, making hateful statements like the ones made by Mnxitama is as dangerous as throwing lit matches on dry grass. Political inciters like Mnxitama can no longer be allowed to spread racialism and violence without being called to account. Thus, the FF Plus will keep a close watch to monitor the police's investigation into the matter so as to make very sure that he is indeed held accountable for his malicious statements. The FF Plus wants to help build a better future for all in South Africa and will not hesitate to take action in the interest of all rational South Africans and fight back against anyone who propagates violence and instability.
