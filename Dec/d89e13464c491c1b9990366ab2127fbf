The ANC must put a stop to these senseless political killings The DA in EThekwini is shocked to learn that three ANC councillors in the city have been arrested in connection to the murder of Councillor Maphumulo from Umlazi’s Ward 88. The allegations further perpetuate the notion that the ANC is at the centre of political killings KwaZulu-Natal making it difficult for competent public representatives to action their duties due to fear of being assassinated. Having said the above, we respect the principal being assumed innocent until proven guilty and thus call on the ANC to tentatively recuse the suspected councillor from partaking in council work and any other community-based work for the duration of the court proceedings. We understand that this is a developing matter and that it must be treated with the sensitivity it deserves. To the Maphumulo family and friends, we say these are positive strides in getting to the bottom of this and urge that all stakeholders allow the law to take its course. It cannot be right that in all efforts to building One South Africa for all, we still have such instances of political killings. We will be monitoring this case and its associated developments.
