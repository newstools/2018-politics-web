Farm attacks are increasing in the Western Cape 3 December 2018 Three farm attacks occurred in the Western Cape between 23 and 26 November 2018 – in the Porterville, Paarl and Wellington regions respectively. The words “Kill the boer”, “Viva Juju” and “Viva EFF” were written in spray-paint on the door of the farmhouse six weeks before the Porterville attack. Fuel was also poured over one of the family members, while another one was sexually assaulted. “Farm attacks in the Western Cape are busy increasing – we are already aware of seven such attacks in the Western Cape that occurred in November 2018, but luckily no murders were committed,” says Johandré van Zyl, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety for the Southern Region. “AfriForum is involved across the country to render assistance and support to communities and is working hard to enable these communities to organise themselves within the framework of the law. “We encourage people – especially those living in desolated and rural regions – to take responsibility for their own safety and to accomplish this by establishing farm watches. We are moving closer to the festive season and would like to make a plea to people to sharpen their readiness during this time,” concludes Van Zyl.
