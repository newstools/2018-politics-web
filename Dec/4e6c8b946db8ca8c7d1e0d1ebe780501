More details on jobs-for-sale scandal at Bheki Mlangeni hospital 6 December 2018 Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa has given more details on the jobs-for-sale scandal at the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital in Soweto in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. She says that there were 63 disciplinary cases related to cash for jobs, of which 11 were job sellers and 52 people who got jobs by paying for them. Furthermore: “the 11 sellers of jobs were all dismissed/resigned at the face of the disciplinary hearing. No one was dismissed for self-incriminating, cooperating with investigation and disciplinary process.” All of the 52 people who paid for their jobs received sanctions short of dismissal, and are still in the following jobs: Cleaners - 20 Clerks - 15 Porters - 7 Enrolled Nurses - 10 According to Ramokgopa: “Employees found guilty after pleading guilty before independent Presiding Ofﬁcers were given sanctions, suspensions without pay including final written warning, owing to the evidence presented to an independent Presiding officers which such evidence may evince a degree of remorsefulness, divulging honestly and truthfully.” I am uneasy at the leniency shown as jobs-for-cash rackets and also jobs-for-sex are quite prevalent in hospitals and throughout the Gauteng Provincial Government. It is grossly unfair that unscrupulous people get jobs that would have gone to better qualified people. Fair access to jobs should be guaranteed with honest administration and punishment of those who seek to profit from the desperation of job seekers.
