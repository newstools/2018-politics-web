Hawks catch ANC leaders red-handed trying to bribe DA Councillor 13 December 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) can confirm that three ANC leaders in Abaqulusi local Municipality have been arrested by the Hawks after offering a bribe to a DA councillor. This is after a Council meeting that was going to take place where there was going to a motion of no confidence against the Speaker. The DA councillor was offered a bribe in order to vote for the ANC at this meeting. We applaud our councillor's urgent move to prevent ANC corruption rot. The ANC leaders were caught red-handed by the Hawks where they were meeting the DA councillor to hand over a substantial amount of money. The failing AC has sunk to its lowest low - enough to resort to bribes in their thirst for power. We have seen this trend by a desperate ANC evolve in different forms in Mangaung and Nelson Mandela Bay. We can only predict that this forms part of the failing ANC’s election strategy, sanctioned by Luthuli House. The DA congratulates the Hawks for their quick and efficient work in fighting corruption that has infested this country. We applaud those men and women in our law enforcement who continue fighting against criminals without the necessary support for the government. The DA is committed to enforcing a minimum 15-year sentence for individuals found guilty of corruption. Corrupt individuals regardless of which party they belong to must face the full might of the law. Issued by Zwakele Mncwango, DA KZN Premier Candidate, 13 December 2018
