ANC overwhelming victory in by-elections 13 December 2018 The African National Congress is encouraged by the outcomes of the municipal by-elections held across the country on 12 December 2018.  We are humbled by the confidence our people have demonstrated in the ANC.  In Gauteng the ANC retained the ward in the Tshwane Metro achieving 63.88% of the vote. In KwaZulu-Natal the ANC retained the ward in Alfred Duma Municipality and won the ward in Mtubatuba Municipality previously won by the IFP with 50.13% and 56.02% respectively.  In Limpopo the ANC won overwhelmingly in the Mogalakwena Municipality with 73.62% of the vote, an increase from 47.81% in 2016. In the North West the ANC increased its majority in the two wards in the Ramotshere Moiloa Municipality securing 70.52% from 54.21% in 2016 and 42.80 from 31.60% in 2016 respectively.  In the Western Cape the ANC wrestled two wards in the Matzikama and Cederberg Municipalities from the DA with 49.54% and 49.19% respectively.  The DA retained one ward with reduced majority in Saldanha. The ANC is encouraged that these results demonstrate the renewed confidence South Africans have in the ANC. These outcomes appear to be in line with the report released by the South African Institute of Race Relations confirming that ANC support is on the rise, whilst that of the opposition is declining. This outcome is a further encouragement for people to register to vote to ensure overwhelming victory for the ANC in 2019.  We salute the dedication and hard work our volunteers put in mobilizing voters to rally behind the ANC. All ANC councillors must continue to work hard to realise the aspirations of our people. The work of all ANC public representatives is to decisively and irrevocably push back the frontiers of poverty, with the people at the centre of our socio-economic transformation project. We call on all South Africans to heed the call to register to vote and exercise their civic duty at the polls. Issued by Zizi Kodwa, Acting National Spokesperson, ANC, 13 December 2018
