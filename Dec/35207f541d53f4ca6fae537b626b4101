DA to refer ANC’s City of Johannesburg State Capture allegations to Zondo Commission 6 December 2018 Today, amaBhungane, revealed how the former ANC City of Johannesburg Mayor, Parks Tau, and former City MMC for Finance, Geoff Makhubo, allegedly syphoned R30-million from the City of Johannesburg. Makhubo allegedly acted as a broker for Regiment Fund Managers, which gave them unrestricted access to lucrative contracts within the City. These latest revelations are once again proof that State Capture was indeed an ANC sponsored project. Whether on a local level or the very top, the ANC facilitated the Guptas’ capture of the public coffers. Regiments have been heavily implicated in the ANC and Guptas’ State Capture project. What is clear from these revelations is that Regiments wanted to seemingly use the ANC in order to benefit from the State Capture project, which would ultimately benefit the Gupta family and their henchmen. With the help of Makhubo’s and Tau’s interference, Regiments was allegedly able to facilitate an R290 million loan to Denel – all whilst also receiving kickbacks of R3.42-million from Denel for seemingly securing this deal. The DA will now refer these revelations to the Zondo Commission of Inquiry. The brazenness of the ANC, Makhubo and Tau’s criminality is astounding, and we cannot allow for this type of brazen corruption to continue. It is evident that the rot of State Capture has seeped in every level of the ANC. The ANC must answer for their role in State Capture before the Zondo Commission and face the full consequences of their corruption. The DA is committed to rooting out corruption from government. We will build One South Africa for All, where all those who are found guilty of corruption spends a minimum of 15 years behind bars.
