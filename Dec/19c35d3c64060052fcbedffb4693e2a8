ANC outraged by attacks on Western Cape farms 17 December 2018 ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs has spoken out against the spate of farm attacks in the Western Cape, slamming each assault on the farming community as one against the country, black and white, and also food security. Jacobs expressed his outrage after a farm worker was killed when seven men allegedly robbed a farm in Philippi. One of the alleged attackers also died in the weekend attack, while two others were arrested in follow-up operations. Last week an elderly farmer and his wife were murdered in their home on their Bonnievale farm. A suspect has been arrested and is expected to appear in court tomorrow (Tuesday, 18 December 2018). Lauding the arrest in connection with the Bonnievale attack, Jacobs said: “Every attack on a farm is an attack on our country. Each loss of life in these criminal attacks is regretted and is mourned. We call on all our people to stand together to defeat these criminals. “We want to thank police for their swift action and call on them to intensify intelligence operations against those behind this. We call on our courts to impose the most severe sentences on those found guilty of attacking farms.” Jacobs also urged farmers to stop evictions and human rights abuses and exhorted them to create an environment for peace and productivity in rural communities.
