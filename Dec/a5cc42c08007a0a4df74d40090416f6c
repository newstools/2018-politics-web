MONDAY 31 DECEMBER 2018 PRESIDENT SADDENED BY WUPPERTHAL DEVASTATION President Cyril Ramaphosa has expressed his sadness at the destruction by fire of community amenities and cultural assets at the Moravian mission station of Wupperthal in the Western Cape. The blaze on Sunday, 30 December 2018, destroyed dozens of homes, the town hall, school, clinic and shopping centre in the historic village, leaving a reported 200 residents homeless. “The nation’s thoughts go out to the people of Wupperthal who have suffered terrible personal losses alongside cultural assets that are of importance to all South Africans and especially Moravian congregations across the Western Cape.” President Ramaphosa said government – notably the Departments of Local Government and Arts and Culture – would work with the Wupperthal community to being relief to the area. The President commended initiatives launched by various communities and organisations to assist Wupperthal residents in the midst of devastation that has cast a pall over a traditional period of festivity and relaxation.
