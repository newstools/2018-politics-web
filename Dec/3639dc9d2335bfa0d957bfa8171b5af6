Dondo Mogajane must fall on his sword. 20 December 2018 If the Public Protector report today is complete and accurate Dondo Mogajane, the Director General of National Treasury must do the right thing and fall on his sword. There can be no reason why Dondo Magojane failed to disclose his criminal conviction on his application for the post of Director General of National Treasury. This is particularly surprising as the Public Protector report found that Magojane disclosed his criminal conviction a mere two years prior when he applied for the Deputy Director General post. The bottom line is that the non-disclosure, even if the criminal conviction itself may not have prevented his appointment, was completely unacceptable and is an act of dishonesty. As the Director General of National Treasury, Dondo Magojane holds a position of utmost honesty and the nondisclosure of his criminal record is particularly egregious.
