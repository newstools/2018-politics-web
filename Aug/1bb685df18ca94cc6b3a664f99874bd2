No firm date for new CEO at Bara Hospital 28 Augustus 2018 The Gauteng Health Department is “quite advanced” in the process of filling the CEO vacancy at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital (CHBH). Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said this today in an oral reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature, but did not give a firm date for the appointment of a new CEO. I am disappointed that there has been such a long delay in appointing a capable person to run this hospital which desperately needs strong leadership to provide a quality health service. There is no good reason why the hospital has been without a permanent CEO since January 2016 when former Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu, removed former CEO Sandile Mfenyane without explanation. Yesterday, the unions organized a protest march against Acting CEO Dr Sifiso Maseko, who they blame for alleged corruption and irregular appointments. Ramokgopa has said previously that the CEO position was advertised with a closing date of 15 December 2016 and four applications were received, so why has it still not been filled? Poor management is partly to blame for the high number of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that have harmed patients at this hospital - 1249 SAEs in 2016 and 2085 SAEs in 2017. I hope that an honest and effective CEO is appointed as soon as possible as our largest hospital has been rudderless for far too long.
