DA CALLS ON GAUTENG HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE PROOF OF ESIDIMENI NURSE REFERRALS The Democratic Alliance calls on the Gauteng Health Department to provide proof that they have referred all health officials involved in the Esidimeni tragedy to the relevant health professional bodies. This is necessary as according to a report by the Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism, the SA Health Professions Council (SAHPC) has confirmed that former head of department Dr Barney Selebano was referred in December last year, but the SA Nursing Council says that only one of the three implicated nurses has been referred to it. It is unclear which of the implicated nurses has been referred to the SANC. According to Justice Dikgang Moseneke the following should have been referred: former director of mental health Makgabo Manamela and her deputy Hannah Jacobus, and chairperson of the Gauteng Mental Health Review Board Dumi Masondo. The Department should ensure that all three nurses are referred to the SANC, which should act to revoke their licenses for their role in the Esidimeni deaths. I am also concerned that Dr Selebano has yet to appear before a SAHPC preliminary committee of inquiry, and is still able to practice pending the outcome of his case. There should be a minimum of delays in ensuring professional accountability in this matter. Professionals who grossly disregard their duty as in the Esidimeni case should never be allowed to practice again. Statement issued by Jack Bloom MPL, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 3 August 2018
