17 students arrested after clashing with cops at UKZN's Westville campus 13 August 2018 Seventeen students have been arrested for public violence after clashing with police at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's (UKZN) Westville campus on Monday. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala told News24 that about 300 students who had gathered at the campus at about 08:00 threw stones at the police. "There are police vehicles that were damaged during the violent protest," she said. She said the 17 students would appear in court soon for public violence. Police are still at the scene to stabilise the situation, according to Gwala. News24 reported on August 8 that the university had suspended lectures at the Westville campus following a violent confrontation between police and students. The protest came after students raised issues over the administration of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, shuttle service timetables and amenities at some residences. University spokesperson Normah Zondo said last week that the academic programme at the campus would resume this Monday. News24
