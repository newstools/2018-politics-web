COSATU North West and NUM to protest against planned retrenchment at Impala Platinum 6 August 2018 COSATU North West is deeply disappointed to hear that Impala Platinum is retrenching 13 000 workers in the next two years at Rustenburg. This comes while the nation is struggling with triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality. We have since resolved to work with the NUM to organise a massive action on the 17 August 2018 to demand that Impala Platinum must with immediate effect stop their intention of retrenching so many workers. We are making a call to both provincial and national government particularly the Minister of Mineral Resource to engage Impala and instruct them to stop the retrenchments. These retrenchments will exacerbate an already worse situation of employment in province and the country .We call upon workers to be united and more vigilant in fighting jobs losses, especially in mining sector.
