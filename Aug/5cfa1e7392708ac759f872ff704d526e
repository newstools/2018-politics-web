Acting head of NPA will have to prove himself 15 August 2018 The recently appointed acting head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Dr Silas Ramaite, will have to prove that he can act independently and that he was not contaminated during the term that he served as the deputy of the discredited adv Shaun Abrahams, former head of the NPA. The swift action taken by President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint an acting head is welcomed. It, however, is lamentable that the President did not appoint someone without any NPA baggage. Dr Ramaite is well grounded in the law and boasts with various degrees. In 1988, he was admitted to the bar as advocate of the High Court and in 2001, he was appointed senior advocate. The advantage for Dr Ramaite is that he is a highly-qualified lawyer and advocate with fifteen years of experience in the NPA. However, the term he served at the NPA over the last few years will put Dr Ramaite in the spotlight while he has a great task ahead of him as he will have to restore the credibility of the office of the NPA and prove that he is not under the control of a political puppet master.
