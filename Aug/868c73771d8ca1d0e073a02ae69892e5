DA eThekwini rejects R2 million price tag for bloated delegation to Brazil and Colombia 28 August 2018 The Democratic Alliance has voted against an item in the eThekwini Executive Committee to send fifty-four people on a trip to Brazil and Colombia. The trip will cost R 2 million of Public Transport Network Grant funding. The delegation will consist of two councillors, thirty-three minibus taxi operators and representatives, fourteen bus operators, and five municipal officials. The DA supports the development of the bus rapid transit system in Durban and recognizes the urgent need for an improved public transport system but this should not come at a price tag that could be better used for the delivery of services. Benchmarking and international best practice is an important part of improving our own systems, but can easily be learnt without an elaborate overseas trip. National Treasury guidelines specifically request frugality and for municipalities to cut back on overseas trips and needless expenditure. The eThekwini Transport Authority is increasingly embarking on incredibly expensive and aspirational projects that aren't able to achieve their own targets. A few months ago, the city increased the budget for the Moja Cruise taxi incentive programme to a staggering R 202 million, money that could be better utilized for service delivery. The DA will continue to work for the people of eThekwini by minimizing needless expenditure by the City, to build one South Africa for all.
