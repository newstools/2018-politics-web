AfriForum welcomes government’s decision not to appeal Grace Mugabe ruling The civil rights initiative AfriForum welcomed the South African government’s decision not to appeal the Gauteng South High Court ruling to set aside Grace Mugabe’s diplomatic immunity. AfriForum also welcomes government’s indication that it would pay AfriForum and other parties’ legal costs, as the Court ordered. According to Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, it is unfortunate that government did not heed AfriForum’s warnings that the diplomatic immunity granted to Mugabe had been unconstitutional. “It is unfortunate that AfriForum first had to approach the courts to compel government to do the right thing by withdrawing Mugabe’s diplomatic immunity.” Kriel requested the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to start prosecuting Mugabe as soon as possible. The NPA should also be ready to arrest Mugabe if she decides to return to South Africa. “The victim in the case, Gabriella Engels, has waited long for justice to be served.” Kriel says that Adv. Gerrie Nel and his team at the organisation’s private prosecuting unit are ready to privately prosecute Mugabe if the NPA fails to do so. Statement issued by Kallie Kriel, AfriForum CEO, 3 August 2018
