EFF STATEMENT ON NELSON MANDELA BAY AND REMOVAL OF TROLLIP Tuesday, 07 August, 2018 The EFF would like to inform society and the people of Nelson Mandela Bay that there are ongoing talks within the opposition parties on the removal of the DA mayor, Athol Trollip. These consultations have not reached any conclusion, nevertheless, majority of the parties have agreed on the removal of Athol Trollip. There are still ongoing talks on an alternative candidate to replace the sitting mayor. Whatever these discussions, the EFF will not support any candidate from the Patriotic Alliance for the position of Mayor, but we are willing to engage all other political parties to present a different candidate. Our hatred for racism will never be manipulated to vote a party of unrepentant fraudsters. EFF will never give the City of Nelson Mandela to thugs. If there is no worthy candidate from opposition benches the EFF will not participate. However, we support the motion of no confidence against Athol Trollip. The EFF will keep society, particularly the people of Nelson Mandela, informed on the final decision relating to these talks. We reiterate that we remain committed to support an alternative candidate that is morally sound, anti-racist and capable of leading a pro-poor agenda in the City of Nelson Mandela Bay.
