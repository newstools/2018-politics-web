Ramaphosa to reflect on TRC for Tutu peace lecture 20 August 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the annual Desmond Tutu lecture, reflecting on the TRC as it reaches its 20th anniversary, the Tutus’ Foundation announced on Sunday. “Archbishop Emeritus Tutu asked the President to reflect in his lecture on the course of South Africa’s restorative justice project 20 years after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,” the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said in a statement. “South Africa’s negotiated settlement and approach to post-apartheid justice were internationally regarded as a beacon of hope,” said programme manager Razaan Bailey. “To have a leader of the negotiations process, who is now our President, reflect on the nation’s journey to date is a rare opportunity to collectively consider our progress, our successes and shortcomings, and the lessons we have learned along the way. The 8th annual Desmond Tutu International Peace Lecture will take place at Artscape in Cape Town, on 8 October – the day after Archbishop Tutu’s 87th birthday. Previous speakers include The Dalai Lama, Graça Machel, Thuli Madonsela, Mary Robinson, the late Kofi Annan, Advocate Hila Jilani and Advocate Vasu Gounden. The event is open to the public but prior registration in order to receive tickets is required. The process of obtaining tickets will be announced in September. News24
