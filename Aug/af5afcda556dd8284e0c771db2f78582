EFF MARKS THE 6TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARIKANA MASSACRE Thursday. 16 August, 2018 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) marks the 6th Anniversary of the Marikana Massacre which took place on the 16th of August 2012 where the South African Police Service (SAPS) opened fire on black mineworkers who were demanding a living wage of R12,500. This fateful day, like the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre and the June 16 1976 Massacre is a reminder of the inhumane atrocities that prevail when there is a moral degeneration, and kleptocracy becomes the order of the day. The ANC-led government proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that they do not care for black lives. With the complicit and direct participation of Cyril Ramaphosa, Nathi Mthethwa and Susan Shabangu. who still have their jobs in cabinet. black workers were criminalized and senselessly killed by a democratic regime. The ANC remains a perfect tool in the hands of white monopoly capitalists to ensure that all blacks remain in the state of colonial indignity where they are cheap and easily disposable labour. We take this opportunity as the economic emancipation movement to renew our vow, in memory of all the 34 mineworkers who were killed that day, we shall remove the ANC from power. We shall ensure that mineworkers get a living wage and that mines finally come into the hands of a democratic, corrupt free state for the benefit of all. May the undying spirit of all the workers live long to inspire us to never again betray black people for the sake of white monopoly capitalists.
