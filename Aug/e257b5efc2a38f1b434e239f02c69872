ANC emphatically against retrenchments 15 August 2018 The African National Congress is emphatically against any retrenchments in both the private and public sectors. The mining sector is an industrial development backbone upon which our economy relies. Over the years, the mining sector has been shedding jobs, and the recent pronouncement of more than 50 000 purported job losses across the board is shocking, as every mineworker benefits 7 or more family members. In terms of Section 52 of MPRDA which enjoins all the parties, we call on the sector to urgently convene a dialogue aimed at finding alternative solutions to this impasse. It is unsustainable that mineworkers continue to bear the brunt of losses, as this is not necessarily a function of productivity, but historical and irrational management decision.
