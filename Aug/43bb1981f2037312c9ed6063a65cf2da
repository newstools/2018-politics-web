ANC concerned about disruptions in WCape transport system and condemns torching of buses 6 August 2018 ANC calls for a permanent resolution to the Taxi Industry's various challenges and concerns, permanent solutions to the train security and operational challenges and a better operational model for mycity bus and the busing system. Todays torching of buses and other destruction exacerbates the enduring transportation system challenges in this province. It is also a criminal act which must be swiftly dealt with by police. We would like to remind all stakeholders, including community members of the importance of the transport system on the wellbeing of our societies and the consequences of disruptions or destruction of this transport system for the users and society. Westen Cape already has a scattered transport system that is hard to maintain or fully recover once its disrupted or destroyed. Our transport system is yet another reflection of a divided city that we are and we need a fully intergrated system whose many aspects can leverage each other and minimize vulnerability. We call on MEC of Transport to show leadership in resolving the crisis that is the transportation system in this province.
