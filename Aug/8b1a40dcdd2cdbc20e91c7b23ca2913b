Seven days without water for residents of Zwelibomvu, Nteke and Tafelkop 1 August 2018 Today is the seventh day without water, no water trucks and no water alerts in Ward 100. This is the challenge that residents of rural Zwelibomvu, Nteke and Tafelkop experience every single month. The Councillor is nowhere to be found as taps run dry for days in this rural area. For more than two decades, the rubbish collection service has not been functional in this ward, the clinic service only comes once a month, roads are in a terrible condition and there are no playgrounds for children. This area is forgotten and discarded by the uncaring ANC government. It is clear that the ANC government could not care less for residents of rural areas in the province. Next year they will be coming with empty promises whilst they have been ignoring residents' pleas for the last four years. People of Ward 100 and the whole of eThekwini and KwaZulu Natal have seen the ANC for what it is: a greedy, self-centred and a factional party, hell-bent on feeding the connected few at the expense of the disadvantaged and the most vulnerable. While the people suffer, the eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede is busy bribing contractors for her benefit and her party. The DA has since written to the Head of Water and Sanitation Councillor Ednick Msweli to find out when will water be supplied to these residents. Read the letter here. People of Ward 100 and the whole of KwaZulu Natal will reject the ANC in 2019, they will vote for a party that has a track record of putting people first where it governs. The DA will continue to push the governing party to provide services to the people. The DA remains the only party that cares for the people and has a record of clean governance and providing services to the people. It is the only party that is focused on building a better future for all. Issued by Zandile Mkhize, DA eThekwini Councillor, 1 August 2018
