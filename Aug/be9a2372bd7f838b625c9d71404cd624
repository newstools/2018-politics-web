Abrahams is packing and is ready to vacate his office - NPA 15 August 2018 The National Prosecuting Authority said on Wednesday that former prosecution head Shaun Abrahams was well in the process of packing up and vacating his office. "He [Abrahams] indicated that he wanted to be given an opportunity to clear his office this week. He is not working. Remember he worked for the NPA for 23 years. When he was appointed to this position, he moved from another office," NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said. Mfaku said Abrahams also had to do a handover with newly-appointed acting prosecutions boss Silas Ramaite. "He [Abrahams] is also engaging with Dr Ramaite on matters where he has historical knowledge," Mfaku said. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Ramaite on Tuesday. Ramaite replaces Abrahams, who was forced to vacate his office following the Constitutional Court ruling on Monday. The court found that Abrahams's appointment was invalid because his predecessor, Mxolisi Nxasana, was wrongfully removed by then-president Jacob Zuma. The court ruled that Nxasana must pay back the R10m Zuma paid him to leave the post. Ramaphosa now has three months to choose a new NPA head. News24
