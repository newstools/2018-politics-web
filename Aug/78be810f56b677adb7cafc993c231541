AfriForum lays charges against Malema for firing off shots 1 August 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum just laid charges against Julius Malema, Leader of the EFF, at the Lyttelton Police Station in Centurion. These charges follow after Malema this past weekend fired various shots using an assault rifle during the EFF’s 5-year festivities in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape. These charges include: Shooting with a firearm in a built-up or public area without sufficient reason and the possession of a firearm and ammunition without the necessary license and authority. The video clip from which the charges originate was distributed widely on social media. It was allegedly recorded by a police member who also attempted to lay charges against Malema using the video. According to this person the police however refused to accept the charges. AfriForum is concerned that the conduct by the police in this context does not align with their alleged view in the media regarding their concern over firearms. “Malema once again confirms that his modus operandi involves acting blatantly and without respect for any legislation or judicial authority. As leader of a political party, this behaviour is reckless, seeing as his supporters can possibly emulate his conduct and contempt for the law. His behaviour comes down to the blatant incitement of people and simply cannot pass unpunished,” says Marnus Kamfer, Law and Risk Manager of AfriForum’s Community Safety Division.
