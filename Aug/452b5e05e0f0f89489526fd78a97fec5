AfriForum obtains legal opinion on proposed amendments to school regulations in Gauteng 6 August 2018 It is with concern that the civil rights watchdog AfriForum takes note of the proposed amendments to school regulations that were published in the Government Gazette of 30 July 2018 by Panyaza Lesufi, MEC for Education in Gauteng. According to the proposed amendments, learners and their parents would not have to mind a school’s vision and mission, or even its code of conduct, when learners are enrolled in schools. “The Department of Education is increasingly restricting the voice of parent governing bodies at public schools. Nevertheless, involved communities are necessary for schools to be successful. The Gauteng Department of Education is therefore knowingly eroding the success basis of schools for political reasons, such as the attack on Afrikaans education,” says Carien Bloem, AfriForum’s Coordinator for Education. The Hoërskool Overvaal case made it apparent how important active school management and governing bodies are. “AfriForum is therefore obtaining a legal opinion on the constitutionality of these amendments to the regulations.” The public has until 30 August 2018 to comment on the proposed amendments or to suggest changes to the amendments. AfriForum Education will involve members of the organisation and the public in giving input in this regard. More information on this subject will be communicated throughout.
