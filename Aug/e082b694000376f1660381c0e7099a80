President Ramaphosa intends to institute inquiries into Advocates Jiba and Mrwebi 2 August 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa has today informed Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions Adv Nomgcobo Jiba and Special Director of Public Prosecutions Adv Lawrence Mrwebi of his intention to institute inquiries into their fitness to hold office. The inquiries will be established in terms of section 12(6) of the National Prosecuting Authority Act. President Ramaphosa has invited Adv Jiba and Adv Mrwebi to make submissions by 10 August 2018 as to why they should not be suspended pending this inquiry. In letters to Adv Jiba and Adv Mrwebi, President Ramaphosa said: “I cannot underscore the importance of the public’s trust in the National Prosecuting Authority and its most senior management. It is a constitutional institution that is central to the proper administration of justice. Doubt about the fitness and integrity of any one in so senior a position as you hold jeopardises this trust and the ability of the NPA as a whole.” “The allegations made in these various judgments have been in the public domain for many years now, and despite the litigation at issue not reaching conclusion the pronouncements by these various members of the judiciary have negatively tainted the image of the NPA and will continue to do so until fully ventilated and addressed,” he said.
