New Western Cape Police Ombudsman appointed 16 August 2018 Premier Helen Zille has announced a new Western Cape Police Ombudsman, following a thorough selection, consultation and approval process. “I welcome the approval of appointment in the Provincial Standing Committee on Community Safety in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament today of Major General Johan Brand as the new Provincial Police Ombudsman. Major General Brand has been a key partner in implementing the Khayelitsha Commission of Inquiry recommendations. We look forward to him brining this expertise into the office of the police ombudsman,” said Premier Helen Zille. “Major General Brand has served as Cluster Commander for Khayelitsha since July 2014. His extensive 33 years’ experience in the South African Police Service has made him a pillar of strength in forging improved relationship between communities and police, in areas such as Khayelitsha and beyond. “His knowledge and unique skillset in understanding the laws governing our Republic, their implementation, as well as the policing service delivery constraints in our province, has set him apart as the preferred candidate to be appointed as the next Western Cape Police Ombudsman,” said Minister of Community Safety, Dan Plato. Premier Zille said that under the Western Cape Community Safety Act (CSA), the Western Cape Police Ombudsman has important powers and functions to investigate complaints about police inefficiency or a breakdown in the relations between a community and the police. “I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the previous Ombudsman, Adv. Vusi Pikoli, who played a pivotal role in affording the Office of the Ombudsman the credibility it deserves as envisaged under the CSA and we thank him for his dedicated service to both the Western Cape Government and the people of this province,” said Premier Zille.
