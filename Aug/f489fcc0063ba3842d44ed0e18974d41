DA condemns Malema’s racially divisive comments against Jewish South Africans The Democratic Alliance (DA) strongly condemns the racist remarks by the EFF Leader, Julius Malema, against Jewish people. At a press conference on Thursday, Malema is quoted saying that “[t]hey will kill us for that. There’s a group of white right-wingers who are being trained by Jews in Pretoria to be snipers”. These comments are yet another example of the EFF ‘s crusade to divide South Africans on the basis of race. This kind of racial rhetoric is fundamentally undemocratic and goes against the non-racial South Africa our country committed to building in 1994. The EFF must once and for all admit that they are a nationalist organisation, that seeks to and thrives on a dividing South Africans with hate. No South African deserves to be vilified and excluded by any political organization solely based on their race, heritage or culture. Such Constitutional ignorance has no place in our society. The Preamble of the Constitution states that “South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity”. Unlike the EFF, the DA is the only party that has a proven record of inclusivity and diversity. The people have the choice to vote against hate and to vote for the party who is committed to building One South Africa for All.
