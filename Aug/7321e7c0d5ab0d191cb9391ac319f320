Silas Ramaite appointed as acting NPA head 14 August 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Dr Silas Ramaite as Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions. Ramaite replaces Shaun Abrahams who was forced to vacate the office following the Constitutional Court ruling on Monday. "While the President is studying the judgment, he is committed to appointing a permanent NDPP well within the 90 days given by the Constitutional Court for such an appointment to be made," Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko said inÂ statement. Ramaite is currently the National Prosecution Authority's Deputy National Director responsible for Administration and Office for Witness Protection. He has served as deputy director for 15 years. Ramaite holds the following degrees: B.Proc (University of Fort Hare), LL.B; LL.M, specialising in Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law and Public International Law; and LL.D specialising in Constitutional Law (University of South Africa). He was admitted as an advocate of the Supreme Court in 1988 and was granted the status of Senior Counsel (SC) in 2001. Ramaphosa had wished Ramaite well in his new role and said he believed this week's court judgment had set the NPA on a path that would restore its integrity and build the nation's confidence in the criminal justice system.
