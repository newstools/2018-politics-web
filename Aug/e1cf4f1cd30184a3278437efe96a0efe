Millions spent on Mahika Mahikeng event not justified 20 August 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West this week wrote to the MEC for Culture, Arts and Traditional Affairs (CATA), Ontlametse Mochware, calling on her to account for the millions of Rands wasted and lost on the annual Mahika Mahikeng event. For the 2018/2019 financial year, a whopping R11 million shortfall is estimated for the hosting of this event, a deficit expected to be supplemented through sponsorship. The DA is concerned that the rapid escalation of this event’s budget since its inception in 2015 is not justified as it did not yield the desired outcomes in terms of economic growth through tourism and job creation. For the 2016/2017 financial year, there was a shortfall of R7 million for payment of artists and service providers, necessitating a reprioritisation of the Department’s budget in order to settle outstanding debts. According to the Department’s first quarter 2018/19 financial report, this event is held over a course of four days, benefitting local suppliers and crafters, therefore boosting the economy by the creation of jobs. This, however, does not promote consistent economic growth, as all of this ends the moment the event is over. The exorbitant amounts of money and resources spent on this event would be better applied to projects that will ensure long-term employment and sustainable development in the tourism sector. We have also submitted questions to the MEC on the status of suppliers and whether procurement procedures are being followed correctly. The DA will leave no stone unturned to ensure accountability for the gross mismanagement of public funds in the North West. Under a DA government, economic growth will be promoted through sustainable job creation. Issued by SP Motswenyane, DA North West Spokesperson on Culture, Arts and Traditional Affairs, 20 August 2018
