Court confirms date for the DA’s Zuma legal fees case 27 August 2018 The DA has received confirmation that our application to review and set aside the agreements between the Presidency and Jacob Zuma, to cover the legal costs incurred by him for his criminal prosecution, will be heard in the High Court in Pretoria on 6 and 7 November 2018, before a full bench. In March, the DA filed papers asking that the agreement be reviewed, declared invalid and set aside. It has been confirmed that the State has already spent at least R15.3 million on Mr Zuma’s legal costs. This figure is likely to be significantly higher as this amount is confined only to the litigation involving the DA. We have also requested that the court order that the R15.3 million already spent be refunded to the State. The DA believes that South Africans have already paid dearly for the ANC’s corruption. Mr Zuma, especially, should not be entitled to any more financial support from the public coffers. The DA will continue the fight to ensure the R15.3 million already spent to defend Zuma is refunded and that he is not given a single cent more.
