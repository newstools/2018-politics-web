Is there a cover-up of baby deaths at the Thelle Mogoerane hospital? 30 August 2018 Urgent action is needed to establish why more babies appear to have died at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus and whether this is being covered up by hospital management. I have been sent a list with the names and patient numbers of nine babies who I am told died this weekend on Saturday at Ward 2 of the hospital. This is exceptionally serious following the deaths of two out of seven babies infected with antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella in July and August this year. We need to know if more babies are dying because of poor hygiene, overcrowding and cross-infection at this hospital. Workers say that the hospital’s CEO Nomonde Mqhayi-Mbambo enjoys political protection which allows her to cover up wrong-doing and act with impunity. They have warned repeatedly that poor working conditions and staff shortages could lead to a disaster, but she has been slow to respond effectively. I have sent the list of alleged new baby deaths to Gauteng Health Department Head Professor Mkhululi Lukhele for his urgent attention. I fear that more babies could die if the Department does not act quickly to fix the deep-rooted problems at this troubled hospital. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 30 August 2018
