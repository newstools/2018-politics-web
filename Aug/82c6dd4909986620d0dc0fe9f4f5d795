DA Youth reports racist Adam Catzavelos to SAHRC 22 August 2018 The Democratic Alliance Youth (DAY) condemns in the strongest possible terms the revolting racist video made by Adam Catzavelos. In a video Catzavelos recorded while on holiday in Greece, he is heard saying “[b]lue skies, beautiful day, amazing sea and not one k****r in sight. F*****g heaven on earth. You cannot beat this". The use of this word is not only racist but it is also appalling that a South African, knowing the significance of this term, would utter these remarks and then communicate them to the world on social media. This kind of vitriol is not only an insult but a criminal offence – which makes the arrogant and brazen manner in which Catzavelos made these comments particularly revolting. The DAY has now referred this to the South African Human Right Commission (SAHRC). We trust that the SAHRC will investigate this matter and hold Catzavelos accountable for his vile comments. He has offended the dignity and human rights of all South Africans, and it is the likes of Catzavelos who seek to divide our society, who must be actively called-out at every turn. It is our collective responsibility to end racism wherever it arises. He, and all those who espouse his views, have no place in a united South Africa. The likes of Catzavelos undermine the project of nation-building and reconciliation that our nation committed to in 1994. The DAY remains committed to building a non-racial society and one South Africa for all. Issued by Luyolo Mphithi, Federal DA Youth Leader, 22 August 2018
