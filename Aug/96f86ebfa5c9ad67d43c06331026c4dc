DA supports march against Qedani Mahlangu and Brian Hlongwa 7 August 2018 The Democratic Alliance supports the march today by the Treatment Action Campaign which is calling for Qedani Mahlangu and Brian Hlongwa to be removed from the Gauteng ANC’s Provincial Executive Committee. They have both been implicated in heinous activities in the Gauteng Health Department, but continue to hold senior positions in the ANC. In the case of Qedani Mahlangu, this is despite her role in the suffering and cruel deaths of 144 Esidimeni mental health patients. In the case of Brian Hlongwa, presently the ANC Chief Whip in the Gauteng Legislature, this is despite the mounds of evidence that implicates him in R1.2 billion of corruption and lack of controls that continues to cripple the health department. Gross insensitivity is displayed by the ANC in both cases as it rewards people who are culpable in misdeeds and corruption. According to the DA’s Hlongwa Monitor, it is now FORTY SEVEN days since the Special Investigating Unit report was made public that implicates Hlongwa in massive corruption, but he has still not been fired. How many more days before he is removed from the Gauteng Legislature and faces trial in court? Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 7 August 2018
