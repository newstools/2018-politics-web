ANC STATEMENT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ZIMBABWEAN ELECTIONS The African National Congress sent a team of election observers at the invitation of ZANU PF. We want to take this opportunity to congratulate ZANU PF for having won a majority of seats in the Zimbabwean national assembly. We also congratulate Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa on his election as President of Zimbabwe. The ANC is confident the results of these elections are a reflection of the will of the people of Zimbabwe. The loss of life and violent outbreaks in the streets is regrettable and we call on all citizens of Zimbabwe, including opposition parties, to accept this democratic outcome. The ANC also wishes to commend the voters and all people of Zimbabwe whose exemplary patriotism has helped to strengthen and promote a culture of democracy in Zimbabwe. Democracy and the people of Zimbabwe have emerged as undisputed winners. We urge the newly-elected leadership to pay focused attention on the socio-economic challenges that confront the people of Zimbabwe. Now is the time to unite the nation and to devote its collective energy towards reconstruction and development. The ANC stands ready to walk this path with the people of Zimbabwe and to lend a hand.
