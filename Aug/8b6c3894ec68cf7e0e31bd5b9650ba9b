Herman Mashaba, Mayor of Johannesburg, invited AfriForum’s Private Prosecuting Unit for a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss corruption cases in Johannesburg. During this meeting Mashaba asked the unit to intervene in corruption cases that have allegedly been dragging on for years or where people simply are not prosecuted. “The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is failing in its duties if corruption cases with sufficient merit for prosecution are dragging on for years and the people are not prosecuted. Nobody should be regarded as being above the law and AfriForum is determined to ensure that equality before the law prevails. AfriForum’s Private Prosecuting Unit will consider every case that Mashaba and his administration refer to us and if we find that there is prima facie evidence to successfully prosecute, we will institute private prosecution,” says Adv. Gerrie Nel, Head of AfriForum’s Private Prosecuting Unit. Statement issued by Adv. Gerrie Nel, Head: Private Prosecuting Unit, AfriForum, 3 August 2018
