DA calls on MEC to provide support for traumatised pupils after corporal punishment incidents 8 August 2018 Today, Wednesday 8 August 2018, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North west conducted an oversight inspection of the Sol Plaatje Secondary School in Mahikeng, following allegations of a Grade 9 learner being assaulted by a newly-appointed teacher. The DA will table questions to the MEC for Education and Sports Development, Sello Lehari, to ascertain what programmes of training are made available to empower teachers to apply non-punitive measures of learner discipline. These assault allegations came to light when a video was circulated on social media, displaying a despicable act of violence in a classroom where the teacher can be seen hitting a learner with a belt. During the inspection, it was confirmed that the necessary disciplinary steps had been taken against the teacher and that he had immediately been dismissed from the school. The DA is concerned that teachers would resort to the illegal act of corporal punishment as a means of discipline and the lack of training on acceptable and non-punitive measures of discipline in classrooms. The DA will also write to MEC Lehari to enquire about systems that are in place to improve the capacity of the School Governing Body (SGB), school management and teachers in maintaining a culture of good discipline and high academic standards at schools in the North West Province. We appeal to the parents of the Sol Plaatje Secondary School to continue to support the school management in maintaining the excellent academic, sports and cultural ethos of the school.
