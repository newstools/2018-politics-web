Political parties misuse of the land issue for the sake of populism is a dangerous game 22 August 2018 Political parties are misusing the land issue to stir up emotions in South Africa and it may have unforeseen consequences. This was the message conveyed by Dr Pieter Groenewald, leader of the FF Plus, in his memberâ€™s declaration yesterday in Parliament. Here follows the declaration in full: I have said it before in Parliament and I will say it again, land is an emotionally charged matter. I have also called on political parties, more than once, to deal with the land issue in a responsible manner. What we are seeing at present, however, is that political parties are recklessly misusing the land issue to gain populist support in the run up to next year's general elections. The statements made are extremely irresponsible and they divide the community. The views taken are downright dangerous and stir up so much emotion in South Africa that it will eventually bring about a divided country. The FF Plus is calling on all political parties to be rational about land and to stop misusing the land issue, and in particular expropriation without compensation, at the expense of the country's economy in order to make up for their own inability to gain voters' support. The ANC specifically is guilty of speaking out of both sides of the mouth and making dangerous statements about the matter. It must stop, otherwise South Africa may end up having to face unforeseen consequences. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 22 August 2018
