DA questions appointment of Ximba as the Ekurhuleni ‘Security Chief’ 8 August 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng rejects the appointment, made by the Ekurhuleni Mayor, Mzwandile Masina, of the controversial police officer, Nkosana ‘Killer’ Ximba, as his ‘Security Chief’. It is unclear what Ximba’s role will be as a ‘Security Chief’, whether he will be an advisor or head the City’s metro police department, therefore the DA will submit questions in order to get a detailed report of Ximba’s role and responsibilities. Ximba has a criminal record and is alleged to have committed murder, assault and kidnapping. He was also investigated for possession of an unlicensed firearm. Ximba is known as an ally to the controversial former SAPS Crime Intelligence boss, Richard Mduli. Ximba resigned from the SAPS in 2005 and he applied to be reappointed in 2007. It is worrying that despite Ximba having a criminal record, the Ekurhuleni Mayor still hired him. The ANC has a culture of employing people who either have criminal records or are being investigated for committing crimes in their structures to protect their patronage network at the expense of our people. The same can be said about the appointment of Brain Hlongwa and Qedani Mahlangu to the ANC Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). The DA strongly condemns the appointment of people who are still under investigation and those that have been found guilty of committing crime. This undermines the integrity of our legal system and its bodies that have been tasked with investigating these crimes. The people of Ekurhuleni and Gauteng deserve change which appoints ethical and professional personnel who work to put the people first.
