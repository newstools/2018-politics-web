DA welcomes decision to subpoena Ben Le Grange of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V 21 August 2018 The former Chief Financial Officer of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V., Ben Le Grange, gave an undertaking that, in a “spirit of cooperation and transparency”, he would appear before the finance committee in Parliament. However, we have now been informed that he has refused to appear before the finance committee at a scheduled briefing on 29 August 2018 on the grounds that his lawyer is not available. This creates the impression that Ben Le Grange has got cold feet and is trying his best to dodge a grilling on his role in what may turn out to be the biggest corporate scandal in the history of South Africa. We, therefore, welcome the decision [attached here] by the finance committee to request the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, to subpoena Ben Le Grange to appear before in Parliament. Issued by David Maynier, DA Shadow Minister of Finance, 21 August 2018
