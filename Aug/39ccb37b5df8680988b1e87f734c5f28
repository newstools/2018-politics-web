Malema security boss reported to private security governing body AfriForum laid a formal complaint against Adriaan Snyman at the Private Security Industry Regulating Authority (PSiRA). Snyman is alleged to be the owner of a private security firm that provides services to Julius Malema, leader of the EFF. In the complaint, it is requested that Snyman’s actions are investigated regarding the alleged ownership of a suspected firearm and ammunition, as well as the fact that this firearm was given to Malema at the EFF’s five-year celebrations in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape. The complaint relates to the case that was opened on 1 August 2018 against Malema and Snyman at the Lyttelton police station. AfriForum also requests the SAPS to investigate Snyman’s actions and declare whether these constitute a violation of the Firearms Control Act, 2000 (Act No 60 of 2000). “Snyman is a controversial person who allegedly had many run-ins with the law on numerous occasions in the past. If Snyman is in fact the owner of a security firm, he should handle firearms with even more caution than general gunowners do. It is AfriForum’s opinion that PSiRA as well as the SAPS should investigate Snyman’s actions,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety.
