I have caused unspeakable pain to every single person in South Africa. The extensive damage my unfortunate video has caused to a country desperately trying to heal racial tensions is unacceptable. I have been thoughtless and insensitive and shown a complete lack of understanding of what the people in our nation have endured. I have insulted so many of my people. I am not proud. I have watched my video and feel total shame. It is hard to put into words what I want to say and genuinely apologize. I don't expect people to forgive me, but will spend the rest of my life repenting and trying to make up for my total lack of respect and judgement. It is important for people not to think this is what other people in South Africa think. I have offended everyone who wants harmony in South Africa including my family and friends. I alone made these foolish and stupid comments. I do not want my comments to be seen as a reflection of others. I love South Africa and am proud to have lived in such a beautiful and diverse country. So many people have put their love and time into healing South Africa and people like me saying and doing stupid things make it difficult for South Africa to progress. I can only hope that one of the positive outcomes of this are the united voices that have come together against my comments. I apologize unreservedly for the hurt and harm I have caused. To my family, my mom, dad, wife, brother and sisters and my children who mean the world to me, I am so, so sorry. Statement issued by Adam Catzavelos, 23 August 2018
