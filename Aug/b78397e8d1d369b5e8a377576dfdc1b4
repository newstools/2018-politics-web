ANC welcomes Constitutional Court judgment on the National Director of Public Prosecutions 13 August 2018 The African National Congress welcomes and respects the Constitutional Court judgement which found that the appointment of Mr Shaun Abrahams was unconstitutional and invalid. The court found both the manner in which former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head, Mxolisi Nxasana, vacated office and the subsequent appointment of Shaun Abrahams to be unconstitutional and invalid. The ANC believes that todayâ€™s judgement provides President Cyril Ramaphosa with the necessary space to move with speed and urgency to resolve the leadership question at the NPA. What is critical for the ANC is the restoration of the independence, integrity and credibility of this key law-enforcement agency. Anything that compromises the independence of the NPA will undermine its credibility and lead to a serious erosion of the rule of law. The ANC has confidence in its President, who is also the President of the country, Cde Cyril Ramaphosa, to handle this matter in a manner that will restore public confidence in our prosecuting authority.
