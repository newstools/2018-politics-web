AfriForum requests Police Commissioner to investigate Malema’s alleged encouragement of farm murders 30 August 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum has formally requested the National Police Commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, to investigate the claims made by a member of a notorious prison gang that Julius Malema, leader of the EFF, came to see them in prison to encourage the committing of farm murders. In a recorded interview between an agent of the National Intelligence Agency and a general in the 28s prison gang, the gang leader claimed that Malema said that he will arrange a team and will provide balaclavas, firearms and money for them to commit farm murders. The audio clip was broadcast on the current affairs investigative programme, Carte Blanche, in 2017. Ernst Roets, deputy CEO of AfriForum acknowledged possible challenges with the investigation of such a complaint. “However, considering the high frequency of farm attacks and farm murders, we submit that it is in the public’s interest for these allegations to be taken seriously,” he said. A copy of the book Kill the Boer was also provided to the National Police Commissioner for further context on the matter. Roets explained that the fact that Malema has not taken the effort to dispute these claims that were published for the entire country to see is a matter of grave concern. “What is worse, is the fact that these extremely serious allegations, attributed to one of the most influential politicians in the country, has not even been investigated.” Roets said that they will follow up on the matter with the National Police Commissioner.
