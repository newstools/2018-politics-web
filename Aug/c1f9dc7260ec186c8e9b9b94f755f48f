ANC shows that it will stop at nothing: expropriation without compensation 28 August 2018 The FF Plus takes note of the fact that the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Works withdrew the Expropriation Bill earlier today in Parliament. The reason for the withdrawal is to accelerate the process of expropriation without compensation as the process requires that when the Constitution is amended, the amendment must take place through normal legislation. It is, therefore, clear that the ANC will not be brought off track by summits and suggestions from the agricultural sector about how land reform can be sped up and that the party will simply continue on its one-sided track to amend the Constitution so as to make provision for expropriation without compensation. The ANC is misleading the public and agricultural organisations by pretending that the party welcomes plans and suggestions on how to speed up land reform and in this way, the party is creating the false impression that it will not proceed with expropriation without compensation. The Portfolio Committee's withdrawal of the Bill that was drafted in 2015 already serves as proof that the ANC will surely amend the Constitution to make expropriation without compensation possible, thus putting South Africa on a road headed for disaster that will end in a situation similar to Zimbabwe.
