Joint statement on the transfer of SAA Act from Minister of Finance to Minister of Public Enterprises 2 August 2018 The President has transferred the administration of the South African Airways Act, and accompanying functions, from the Minister of Finance back to the Minister of Public Enterprises.1 A proclamation to this effect was gazetted on 1 August 2018. The transfer follows a study commissioned by National Treasury and the Department of Public Enterprises to develop the optimal group structure for the state-owned aviation assets. The recommendations from this study, if considered appropriate, may require implementing changes to the group structure of SAA. As the executive authority for other major state owned companies, including SA Express, the Minister of Public Enterprises is best placed to be the custodian of all of the state’s aviation assets. These assets are South African Airways (SAA) and its subsidiary, Mango, and SA Express. Issued by Ministries of Finance and Public Enterprises, 2 August 2018
