“The pitiful cries of the lost boys of Bird Island have haunted me for the past 31 years. At last their story is out. Chrissy, don’t give up now. You are almost home. No government officials preventing you from investigating this time round.” These were Mark Minnie’s last words to me. They are extracted from a letter written shortly before he died. He called it his “last piece of writing”. This is my reply: “Mark I will keep going. You knew that. I just wish you could have been here to go through all the new leads with me. If only you were still alive to see all the information and incredible confirmation that has come in since the book was published. You would have felt some vindication at last. But I have good news, Mark. There is already enough to start building a new docket. Once we are ready, we will hand it over for further action. That was all you ever wanted. A proper investigation. But you don’t have to worry about it anymore. And nobody is going to steal this docket. Chrissy.” In his final chapter of the book, Mark Minnie said he hoped the boy who was secretly treated in hospital is still alive. “I also hope that if there is anyone out there who has any knowledge of him or any of these missing boys, the Lost Boys of Bird Island, that they will come forward. “Any victims who suffered at the hands of Dave Allen and company, let your voices be heard. Do not remain silent any longer.” It was Minnie’s final wish that victims and people with more information would come forward and that there would be a proper investigation. He wanted the voices of the victims to be heard. Let’s give him his final wish. Anybody with information on the The Lost Boys of Bird Island can e-mail us on birdisland2018@gmail.com. In Minnie’s final note he also says he is tired and is looking forward to eternal rest. The rest of his note is addressed to his family.
