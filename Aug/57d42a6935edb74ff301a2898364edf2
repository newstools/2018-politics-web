Sakeliga requests list of 139 farms intended for expropriation Sakeliga on 8 August sent an application in terms of the Promotion of Access to information Act, 2000 (Act No. 2 of 2000) (PAIA) to the Department of Land Reform and Rural Development in which this business rights organisation requests that the list of 139 farms earmarked for expropriation without compensation is made available to them. Pres. Cyril Ramaphosa last week announced during an ANC gathering that this Department identified suchlike properties for expropriation without compensation. “We would like to inform the concerned landowners of this and assist them with the intended expropriation of their property. The ANC is busy making an enemy of landowners by unfairly targeting them. We will continue opposing this unconstitutional expropriation policy,” says Armand Greyling, Law and Policy Analyst at Sakeliga. Statement issued by Piet le Roux, CEO, Sakeliga, 9 August 2018
