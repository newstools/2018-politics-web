ANC rejects reports of 'shady plan to save VBS' 13 August 2018 The Officials of the African National Congress (ANC) have noted with concern media reports purpoting a meeting where they are supposed to have discussed a “rescue plan” for VBS Mutual Bank. The Officials categorically reject these reports as being a fabrication totally void of any truth. On the contrary, the Officials are more concerned by the loss suffered by the burial societies, the aged and stockvels amongst others. This is money belonging to the most marginalised in our society and should be urgently recovered and returned to their rightful owners. The ANC commends government for its efforts to safeguard monies belonging to the poor and working class and calls on law enforcement agencies to act without fear or favour where there is evidence of wrongdoing, whomsoever is implicated.
