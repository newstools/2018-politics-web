Malema’s gun escapades shoot his security boss in the foot 19 August 2018 AfriForum welcomes the fact that the SAPS confiscated 12 assault rifles found on the premises of Adriaan Snyman, Julius Malema’s security boss. On 1 August 2018 the civil rights organisation laid charges against both Malema and Snyman after Malema fired off what appeared to be an assault rifle during the EFF’s five-year festivities in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape. “In AfriForum’s statement to the SAPS, we give the names of witnesses who saw the alleged firing of the weapon by Malema. These include Dali Mpofu, a senior advocate involved with the EFF, and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, spokesperson of the EFF. AfriForum hopes that the SAPS will get the witness statements of everyone possibly involved in this matter and that these persons will be called as witnesses,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety. “If the SAPS handles the case in such a manner, it will give the National Prosecuting Authority the opportunity to properly peruse the statements, as well as other evidence and refer the matter to the criminal court,” says Marnus Kamfer, Legal and Risk Manager of AfriForum’s Community Safety Department. “AfriForum supports the SAPS and other bodies in the investigation into Malema and Snyman, and are elated about the fact that the SAPS is currently taking strong action against them. AfriForum will continue to monitor the matter,” Cameron concludes. AfriForum has also already laid a formal complaint with the Private Security Industry Regulating Authority against Snyman. Snyman is the owner of a private security firm that provides services to Malema. In this complaint, it is requested that Snyman’s actions are investigated regarding the alleged ownership of a suspected firearm and ammunition, as well as the fact that this firearm was given to Malema to fire.
