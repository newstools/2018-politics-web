Solidarity gives Sasol strike notice 28 August 2018 Trade union Solidarity, on behalf of its members at Sasol, sent a strike notification to the company today. This follows after 95% of the unions' Sasol members in Sasolburg voted to go on strike after 83% of its members at Sasol in Secunda also voted in favour of a strike. This vote therefore serves as a strike mandate and also gives permission to the union to give Sasol the 48-hour strike notice.  This notice however does not necessarily mean that a strike should commence after 48 hours. The members’ vote to strike followed after Sasol’s decision to exclude white employees from its new staff share scheme, Khanyisa, merely because of their race. Documentation available on the Sasol Khanyisa website explicitly states that white employees and foreign nationals are excluded from obtaining shares in terms of this share scheme. “Our members at Sasol unanimously said: Enough is enough. This type of crude racial exclusion cannot be tolerated any longer. These white workers are also valuable,” Solidarity Chief Executive Dirk Hermann said with the delivery of the strike notice. Further details regarding the strike will be made available later. Issued by Francois Redelinghuys, Spokesperson, Solidarity, 28 August 2018
