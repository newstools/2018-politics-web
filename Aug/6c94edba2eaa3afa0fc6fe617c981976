We are pleased that the clean, transparent and service delivery orientated DA-led coalition government will continue its work in serving the people Capital City – led by Executive Mayor, Solly Msimanga. Today, DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, will write to the EFF national leadership requesting an urgent formal meeting to discuss their ongoing co-operation with the ANC in attacking coalition governments across the country, and to seek solutions that are in the best interests of the residents of these cities. The DA-led coalition stands firmly against the corrupt ANC playing politics, trying to get their hands on the people’s money through the back door. The voters rejected the ANC in 2016 because they have failed the people. The coalition in Tshwane will continue to cut corruption, grow the economy to create work, and deliver basic services to all residents. Today was a victory for the people of Tshwane.
