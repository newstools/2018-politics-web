DA lays charges of incitement of violence over Facebook comments 25 January 2018 Today the DA laid charges of incitement to violence at the Vereeniging Police Station against Facebook user, Aubery Thamasanqa Mabele, who called on President Jacob Zuma to “give him a gun to defend our democracy… one bullet, een Boere kind” while checking in at Hoerskool Overvaal. In another post he asked for a “menu for a petrol bomb to burn down the school”. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza failed in his court application to have 55 non-Afrikaans speaking pupils placed at the school, however the department has taken this decision on review. In the weeks subsequent to this, tensions have been running high outside the school from all parties involved. Incitement to cause violence based on language must not be condoned. The rights of all South African’s as enshrined in our Constitution must be respected. It is for this reason that the DA has acted against Mr Mabele. No one should be allowed to encourage violence against another based on language. If we do not act, we will stoop back in to the dark days of our past. We are committed to a united South Africa that grows through its diversity, not one that turns us against each other. Issued by Dady Molo, DA Emfuleni Caucus Leader, 25 January 2018
