Task team not doing enough to curb attacks on Uber and Taxify drivers 30 January 2018 The ongoing war between metered taxi drivers and Uber and Taxify drivers is concerning as the lives of both drivers and passengers are put at risk on a daily basis. This follows the recent fatal attack on a Taxify driver in Yeoville. The DA strongly condemns the latest attack, which took place despite the fact that Gauteng Premier, David Makhura had established a task team to look into the ongoing war between metered taxi drivers and e-hailing taxi operators. It is clear that the Uber task team established by the Premier is not doing enough to curb the ongoing violence. The lack of communication about the work of this special committee shows that the ANC-led government cares little about the safety of Uber and Taxify drivers who have a legal right to be on the road. While the formation of the task team is a step in the right direction, we still have no clarity on how long the investigation into the conflict will be and who exactly is part of the task team. The DA once again calls on Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport, Ismail Vadi and Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane to urgently set up a stakeholder meeting with the metered taxi companies and e-hailing taxi operators to find an amicable solution between these rivals. An urgent update on the work of the Uber task team must be provided as well as  the proposed  steps outlining what action will be taken to curb the attacks and ensure the safety of passengers. The DA believes that a safe and reliable mode of transport is a prerequisite for economic growth, hence it is imperative that Gauteng which is the economic hub of the country has an efficient and affordable transport system.
