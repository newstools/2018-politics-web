DA welcomes resignation of Gauteng Health Head Dr Selebano 16 January 2018 I welcome the resignation of Dr Barney Selebano, the suspended head of the Gauteng Health Department, although it was inevitable that he would have been fired following the conclusion of disciplinary measures for his role in the Esidimeni tragedy. This is not sufficient accountability, however, and he should face criminal charges in a court of law along with former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu and other implicated officials. His resignation clears the way for the appointment of a new head for this troubled department which desperately needs strong leadership to fix budgetary problems and provide quality health care to all patients. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 16 January 2018
