EFF STATEMENT ON MEETING THE SOUTH AFRICAN JEWISH BOARD OF DEPUTIES Monday, January 29, 2018 The EFF leadership met with the South African Jewish Board of Deputies this morning. The meeting was on a request by the SAJBD and it was an introductory meeting. Several issues were discussed including, but not limited to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EFF unequivocally put its non-negotiable position on the condemnation of Israel as an apartheid state and our support for the Palestinian people. The EFF further raised the treatment and deportation of Africans by the Israel government. We further took issue with their silence on H&M referral to Africans in a derogatory manner, whilst they put up a protest against Zara clothing outlet on an anti-Semitic clothing label line. The EFF always meets organizations and formations even if we disagree with them. It is our obligations to communicate our ideas without any fear, even in closed meetings. The SAJBD represents a significant proportion of the South African Jewish community and thus, upon request, we gave them an ear. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 29 January 2018
