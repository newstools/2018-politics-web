COSATU statement on the Pretoria High Court’s ruling on the Brian Molefe saga 25 January 2018 The Congress of South African Trade Union has noted the Pretoria High Court’s decision to dismiss and reject the re-instatement of former Eskom boss Brian Molefe to his position and also ordering him to pay back about R11-million from his pension payout. We are happy that the court has exposed this charade and has excoriated both Eskom and Briam Molefe for concocting such a fraudulent scheme to fleece the power utility. We fully support the calls for the prosecution of Brian Molefe and all those implicated in this mismanagement of Eskom The South African economy and the people of South Africa deserve justice and we want all those who used Eskom as their piggy bank to be held accountable. We hope that all the law enforcement agencies will rediscover their lost fortitude and pursue the peddlers of corruption and their protectors. They must all be brought to court and, if found guilty, punished severely. Issued by Sizwe Pamla, National Spokesperson, COSATU, 25 January 2018
