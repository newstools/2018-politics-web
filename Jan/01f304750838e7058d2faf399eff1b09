Put politics aside and address the water crisis 30 January 2018 The Chairperson of the Select Committee on Social Services has cautioned against pointing fingers and turning the ongoing water crisis in the Western Cape into a political point-scoring match. The people of the Western Cape deserve leadership and guidance during this time and all sphere of government must meet their specific responsibilities to ensure the continued availability of water. The Committee reiterates the need for collaboration between all three spheres of government to provide the requisite leadership and guidance in these times of uncertainty. “We continue to call for full cooperation between the national departments of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, and Water and Sanitation; the Western Cape Department of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning together with the City of Cape Town in finding solutions to this crisis,” said Ms Cathy Dlamini, the Chairperson of the Committee. The Committee further reiterates the call for changes in water-use behaviour. “The people of Cape Town must also chip in and assist by reducing consumption and adhering to restrictions,” Ms Dlamini concluded.
