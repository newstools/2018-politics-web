DA to oppose R55 million salary increase for Emfuleni Councillors The Emfuleni Council will convene a special meeting today to consider salary increases for Councillors. The DA Emfuleni Caucus Leader, Councillor Dady Mollo, will lead the DA in opposing the increase today as the money should rather be spent on improving service delivery in Emfuleni. The DA caucus in Emfuleni has decided to oppose the increase due to the dire state of municipal finances. The increase will amount to R55 119 785 being spent on salaries for Councillors. This amount exceeds the allotted budget for salary increases for Councillors by R4 127 068.25. This increase will mean that Councillors will receive roughly R55 000 per month, however, the bulk of this increase will go to the Mayor, Speaker, Chief Whip and Mayoral Committee Members. With taps routinely running dry, power supplies routinely being cut and refuse removal taking two to three days to collect; it is obvious that the increase is not deserved. As it stands the municipality cannot afford to keep up with the repayments to Rand Water. It currently owes Rand Water over R200 million after having defaulted on its repayment agreements, including the most recent one. If the ANC cared about serving the people of Emfuleni, they would have reallocated the money for salary increases to repaying the outstanding debt which is crippling its delivery. It is clear that the ANC cannot self-correct and is only interested in feeding itself at the expense of the people. We need total change, a new beginning, where the needs of our people are put before ANC greed. Issued by Bongani Baloyi, DA Vaal Regional Chairperson, 18 January 2018
