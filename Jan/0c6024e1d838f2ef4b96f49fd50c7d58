MEC Lesufi must act against SADTU for downing tools in the Vaal region 25 January 2018 The DA has been informed that the South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) in the Vaal region informed parents not to send their children to school today so that their members could attend a march organised by the National Association of School Governing Bodies (NASGB) to Hoërskool Overvaal. It is unacceptable that teachers have abandoned their posts so early in the year, interrupting learning, to attend a march where the issue at Hoërskool Overvaal is currently under court review. Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi must come out of hiding and act against these errant teachers and condemn SADTU for its reckless and negligent behaviour which has undermined the rights of learners. Now is not the time for MEC Lesufi to act coy. He must be decisive and respond swiftly before this situation spreads to other regions in the province. The DA condemns SADTU’s actions and will request that MEC Lesufi make sure that this disrupted school day is caught up at a later point.
