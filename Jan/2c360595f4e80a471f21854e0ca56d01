EFF WELCOMES THE DELAYED APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO STATE CAPTURE BY ZUMA Wednesday, January 10, 2018 The EFF welcomes the delayed appointment of the Commission of Enquiry into State Capture by Zuma. In essence, Zuma has appointed the commission as per the remedial action of the Public Protector's report. We welcome the fact that he appointed a judge solely recommended by the Chief Justice.  The EFF will monitor the processes closely, in particular that the commission sticks to the terms of reference as recommended by the Public Protector's State of Capture Report. In addition, the EFF will apply to have a permanent legal representative in the commission to participate fully in the interrogation of evidence and witnesses.  Finally, we welcome this as an important victory of the EFF as champions of the Zupta Must Fall campaign which has been challenging the capture of the state by the Gupta family as business partners of Zuma. We reiterate our call for Zuma to step down from the highest office in the land as he has not only broken the constitution, but he is at the center of the state of capture investigation itself.  Statement issued by Economic Freedom Fighters, 10 January 2018
