Minister Mokonyane must get to work and address water crisis 24 January 2018 The DA notes the statement released by Water and Sanitation Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, following an earlier media briefing by DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, detailing a programme of action to avert "Day Zero". Recently returned from Liberia, the Minister crowed about her Department’s achievements to date, and committed to holding follow-up meetings with stakeholder to “assess progress … of current interventions and an assessment of new interventions”. We welcome the Minister’s newfound vigour and look forward to these engagements. While the DA thanks the Minister for her offers of help, we call on her to show decisive leadership at this crucial time and action her proposed interventions without further delay. Minister Mokonyane must ensure that her department meets its Constitutional mandate and apply all available resources to respond to the drought crisis, not only in the Western cape but also in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo. It was under Mokonyane’s watch that the Department of Water and Sanitation failed to maintain and upgrade aging water infrastructure, resulting in the inability of national government to supply municipalities with bulk water supply, as is their exclusive mandate. She must now work hand in hand with local and municipal authorities to find solutions to the challenges facing drought-stricken communities and commit to defeating "Day Zero".
