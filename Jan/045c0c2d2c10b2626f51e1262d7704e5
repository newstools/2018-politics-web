SADTU shocked and saddened by killing of a teacher by a learner 16 January 2018 The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU) is shocked and saddened by the death of a teacher who was allegedly stabbed to death by a learner whom he accused of failing him. We condemn this killing in strongest terms. The death of a teacher is one too many. His death is a loss to the profession, his family and society at large. According to news reports, a 15-year old Grade 8 learner went to the teacher’s home in Manyeding Village near Kuruman, Northern Cape on Saturday morning. He allegedly broke all the windows with stones, hit the teacher with a stone on the chest before stabbing him. It is sad to note that as the Union we have been calling on the department to ensure safety in schools, this teacher was attacked at his home. Although we do not want to delve into the merits of the case, we again reiterate our call for parents to be involved in the education of their children. We are aware that most learners taught by our members come from child-headed families and homes where there is a breakdown in the family structure; therefore we call on the community to play a more critical role in the upbringing of children in society. Children should be taught that as much as they have rights, they also have responsibilities. We would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family of the teacher and his school for this untimely loss. As this learner appears in court today, we pray that justice will be served.
