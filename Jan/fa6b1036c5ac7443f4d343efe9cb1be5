SAPU feels policing in Western Cape sacrificed because of politics 9 January 2018 The South African Policing Union calls upon newly appointed national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khehla Sitole to assist the Western Cape police who seem to be battling rampant gangster violence and lack of police crime intelligence capacity. We call upon General Sitole to revive the request made by police minister Fikile Mbalula to the president for the deployment of the Army in the Western Cape. It seems as if the Western Cape is treated as not part of the Republic of South Africa. We are on record calling for a professional policing service in the country. We do not need politics in policing. Political influence will compromise service delivery. SAPU is of the view that the Western Cape SAPS is treated like the stepchild of the SAPS. They have been battling with gangster violence for some time now. The Advocate Vusi Pikoli commission of enquiry into policing in Khayelitsha came with a damning report that we are of the view that up to date the SAPS has done nothing to correct the poor policing issue in the Western Cape. The poor police crime intelligence capacity means we will never win the battle against crime in the Western Cape. Our people have not only lost confidence in the police they do not feel safe weather in the streets or in their own homes. We call upon General Sitole as a career cop whose allegiance is to the country’s constitution to do more for policing in the Western Cape. Functionary members on the ground are frustrated by what they see as political shenanigans. They are only interested in the fight against crime without fear or favour.
