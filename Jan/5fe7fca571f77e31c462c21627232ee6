DA calls on Eskom Inquiry to reconvene urgently following JSE threat to suspend bonds The DA will write to the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Inquiry into Eskom, Ms Zukiswa Rantho, to request that the Eskom Inquiry be reconvened urgently, following reports today that the JSE could possibly suspend Eskom’s bonds by the end of January. Eskom has reportedly failed to publish its six-month interim results by the December 2017 deadline, as required by the JSE. The JSE has now threatened to suspend all Eskom bonds. It is clear that operations at the power utility continue to disintegrate with each passing day, and that there is a lack of decisive leadership at the helm of the parastatal. Members of the Parliamentary Inquiry have not yet received any confirmation as to when the Inquiry is set to reconvene and it is now clear that there is still a lot of work that is to be done. We need to get back to business no later than next week to prevent the complete collapse of Eskom. The DA remains committed to rooting out the corruption at state-owned enterprises, especially those that have been crippled by the Guptas and their henchmen.
