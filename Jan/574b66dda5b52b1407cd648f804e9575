DA calls for extension for public input on proposed SGB amendments 15 January 2018 The DA calls for an extension for public input on the gazetted draft amendments to regulations relating to Governing Bodies of public schools. The proposed amendments were gazetted on 20 December 2017 by Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi. Members of the public and stakeholders in the education sector may submit written comments for a period of 30 days only, however this period will soon end. It was ill-considered of MEC Lesufi to gazette amendments to the Gauteng School Education Act and regulations relating to School Governing Bodies (SGB) during the festive season when the public would be less likely to apply their minds to these amendments. Regulations relating to SGBs cannot simply be pushed through without all stakeholders and the public being thoroughly consulted. Therefore, the DA will request MEC Lesufi to extend the deadline to ensure that an inclusive and transparent process is followed whereby the voice of Gauteng’s residents may be heard. These amendments affect a considerable number of the residents in Gauteng and should be scrutinized to ensure the best possible outcome for our SGBs in the province. Indeed, the DA will make submissions to the proposed amendments to protect the rights of SGBs and limit the powers of the Education Department in dictating how schools in communities should be run. MEC Lesufi would do well to extend the call for public input by at least a further 30 days and consult affected SGBs on the proposed amendments. The DA believes in the decentralization of power and the ability of SGBs to make policy for schools in consultation with the Education Department and in line with the Education Act and Constitution. We do not support the wholesale removal of the powers of the SGB. Issued by Khume Ramulifho, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Education, 15 January 2018
