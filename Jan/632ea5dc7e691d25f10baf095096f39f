Maimane’s populist gimmick endangers Capetonians 31 January 2018 The recent announcement by DA leaders Musi Miamane that he has moved back day zero, would be a funny joke if it was not so serious. Musi Maimane’s treats this crisis as a Public Relations problem for the DA and his grandstanding statements are dangerous. He is confusing the people and sabotaging the strategy that is required to develop a consistent approach to overcoming the water crisis. COSATU is finalising its strike action against the government for endangering the lives of Capetonians through their mismanagement of water  in the city.  We call on President Ramaphosa to assist in the water crisis lest these DA politicians add insult to injury they have caused in Cape Town.
