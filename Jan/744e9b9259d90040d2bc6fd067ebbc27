DA to open a case against ANC Youth League in Tshwane The Democratic Alliance will today lay a charge of incitement of violence with the South African Police Service (SAPS) against the ANC Youth League in Tshwane. This follows a video post by ANC Youth League Leader Lesego Makhubela on Facebook, calling for a total shutdown of Tshwane on 26 January 2018 and praising the use of petrol bombs in this effort. This being part of ANC’s effort to make the city of Tshwane ungovernable. The DA will hand the video clips over to the SAPS and request them to immediately charge Makhubela with hate speech and incitement to violence. Makhubela’s comments are dangerous and in direct contravention to the Constitution which states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression which does not extend to amongst others, incitement of imminent violence.” A call for petrol bombs and the use of violence goes against the struggle for democracy, which sought to protect all citizens from this sort of violent persecution. Since taking office, the DA-led administration in Tshwane has been hard at work to bring about real change and the people are seeing the difference. It’s clear that the ANC also sees the progress that is being made for the people of Tshwane, however, instead of working together to serve the people, they want to resort to using petrol bombs to undermine that progress. It’s clear that the ANC only cares about feeding itself and not about serving the people. The DA-led administration is undoing ANC corruption and will not be intimidated by threats violence.
