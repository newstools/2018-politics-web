EFF REITERATES ITS CALL FOR ALL ACADEMICALLY DESERVING STUDENTS TO REPORT TO UNIVERSITIES OF THEIR CHOICE Tuesday, January 2, 2018 The EFF reiterates its call that all academically deserving students must report to colleges and universities if their choice this year during registration. We condemn and reject the statement by Universities South Africa which announces that there will not be walk-ins in universities. They say only students who applied last year will only be considered for university entrance.  This call by Universities South Africa is a direct participation and collaboration in Zuma's grand-plan to mislead the public. It should now be clear that Zuma announced free education on 16 December when registration had closed. Therefore, universities should be working towards giving expression to the idea by making provisions for all who did not apply because they did not have money to get a chance to apply and be considered. All academically deserving students must be given a chance to take advantage of the free education declaration. Management in universities has always been able to amicably deal with walk-ins for as long as universities have existed. Why must this provision not be made this year when the country needs it the most? It is precisely that many did not have money that they did not apply; thus, since there is a free education provision, let them be given a chance to apply and their applications considered.  The EFF will be at the gates of all universities to ensure that academically deserving students are given a chance and considered. The country must be firm with university managers that they must not close the doors of learning now using useless bureaucratic impediments when funding, which has been the greatest historic impediment has been removed.  Statement issued by Economic Freedom Fighters, 2 January 2017
