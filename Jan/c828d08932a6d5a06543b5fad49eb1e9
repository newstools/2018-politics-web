EFF SENDS CONDOLENCES ON THE PASSING OF LUCAS MANGOPE Friday, January 19, 2018 The EFF send heartfelt condolences on the passing of Lucas Mangope, former leader of the Bophuthastwana Apartheid Bantustan. We extend our condolences to the family, friends and relatives. Although Mangope presided over what is essentially a crime against humanity, it is not a secret that in the end, he came to accept the democratic outcome. It is regrettable that the post-apartheid leadership has still to match Mangope in its commitment to quality service delivery. In fact, they inherited an infrastructure that his illegitimate government had built. They not only failed to maintain it, they have also failed to expand it to the rest of our people. This is alongside a very corrupt record and dismal failure to sustain a moral high ground against the past Mangope represents. Mangope will be remembered as one of the key black figures that apartheid used to try and legitimise itself. He aided the murderous philosophy of anti-black separate development that marginalised black people. Nevertheless, may his soul rest in perfect peace. The same peace Mandela worked hard to realise in our country. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 19 January 2018
