South Africa wake up 17 January 2018 The African National Congress Youth League has noted, with dismay, the incident that took place in Hoerskool Overvaal early today. This school is the same school which was in court colluding with white judges to attempt to maintain the fallen old order of apartheid. When parents, the community and concerned citizens were protesting peacefully outside the school, police were called. As parents were engaged in demonstrating because some of their children were not accepted at the school, police decided to open fire to the demonstrators. Many people were injured as a result of this act, amongst them was the ANCYL Gauteng Provincial Secretary cde Bones Modise. As the ANCYL we calling on the community not to give up the fight our democracy was fought for and it must be defended. We call on the Minister of Police to stop Tweeting and loud hailing on social networks but rather focus his energies on monitoring and disciplining the South African Police Services. It cannot be that just few months back white people without any permission could be safeguarded by his department without anyone being shot but today the same cannot be done. SAPS should stop acting disproportionately where black people are demonstrating peacefully. The ANCYL will be engaging its allies to focus their energies on that school and many others that have such a discriminatory posture. We will pay attention to SAPS as we feel that we black people are consistently under attack from them as they let white people to do as they wish. We will not rest till we deal with demon of racism. White people are like black people there is nothing special about them. We wish cde Bones Modise the Provincial Secretary of Gauteng, and others who were injured, a speedy recovery. South Africa wake up. Issued by Mlondi Mkhize, National Spokesperson African National Congress Youth League, 17 January 2018
