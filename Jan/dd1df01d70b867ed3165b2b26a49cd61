More than R2 million paid to Esidimeni officials who have resigned 18 January 2018 More than R2 million has been paid to the two top Gauteng Health Department officials who have now resigned after being suspended with pay in February last year because of their involvement in the Esidimeni deaths. My estimate is that former Head of Department Dr Barney Selebano was paid more than R1.5 million during his period of suspension, and former Chief Director of Mental Health Dr Makgabo Mananela was paid about R700 000. They will both receive a generous pension as well. It is unfortunate that the disciplinary process against them was delayed by their failed challenge against the findings of the Health Ombudsman’s Esidimeni report and other stalling tactics. Their departure from the department opens the way for new appointments in their former positions who will hopefully improve the quality of health care and avoid the disastrous decision-making that led to the Esidimeni tragedy. I anticipate that Selebano and Manamela will face criminal charges following the police investigation into the Esidimeni deaths, which should include culpable homicide, fraud and contraventions of the Mental Health Act. True justice and accountability will only occur when their culpability is assessed in a court of law. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 18 January 2018
