STATEMENT BY THE CITY’S EXECUTIVE MAYOR PATRICIA DE LILLE At today’s Special Council meeting, I placed the following on record in terms of the matter raised by the Deputy Mayor on the proposed amendments to the System of Delegations. I was never consulted on this matter even though it affects me. Amendments to the System of Delegations must follow due process. The ordinary process for amendments to the System of Delegations is that proposed amendments are either furnished to Executive Support or compiled through a review process conducted by the Delegations Task Team and then tabled in a report from the City Manager for consideration by Council. Reasons must also be provided as to why the delegation/s must be amended. Furthermore, with regard to the delegations proposed for the Deputy Mayor, they may conflict with statutory powers or other existing delegations. In light of due process not being followed before these amendments were proposed to Council, it makes them reviewable.
