COSATU welcomes the freezing of the Gupta Assets  The Congress of South African Trade Unions welcomes the Asset Forfeiture Unit’s decision to freeze the R220m of assets belonging to the Gupta’s and their friends following the looting of the Estina Dairy project in the Free State. COSATU calls on the ANC to suspend all the implicated members of the organisation like Mosebenzi Zwane from their government and organisational positions. The current Secretary General Cde Ace Magashule also has a lot of questions to answer on what happened in that Free State Dairy project. He incubated that naked corruption and all this vulgar looting happened under his watch as the premier of the province. If the ANC is to win the fight against corruption; it needs to give the country’s law enforcement agencies teeth and also give its government a much needed face-lift. All corrupt people need to be relentlessly pursued regardless of their political positions or connections. They must all face the might of the law and pay the price for their looting.
