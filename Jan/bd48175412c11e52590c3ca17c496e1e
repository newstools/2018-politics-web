Crisis in Emfuleni: DA calls for meeting with new Mayor 15 January 2018 Since the departure of disgraced former Emfuleni Local Municipality Mayor, Simon Mofokeng, and the appointment of a new ANC Mayor, Jacob Khawe late last year, residents are still facing considerable challenges. Some of the challenges faced by the municipality is its’ inability to adhere to its debt payment plan to Rand Water, ensuring the municipality keeps the lights on by paying its bill to Eskom, and creating employment opportunities for residents. Over the past few years under the leadership of Simon Mofokeng and the ANC, the administration in Emfuleni committed the following: - Millions of rate-payer rands were spent on Nando’s and KFC, at the peril of an already financially unstable Emfuleni while many residents struggle to put food on the table; - The Former Mayor spent R120 000 a month to hire two luxury “Mercedes Benz” vehicles for himself and the Council Speaker; - The administration has issued only 684 title deeds in Emfuleni over the past 6 years; - Mofokeng allocated the ANC Caucus in council a whopping R778 800 while service delivery is non-existent in the area; - R50 million was spent from 2009 to date on what is now a derelict park in Vereeniging, named Dickenson Park; - Under the leadership of Mofokeng, Emfuleni has spent just over R34 million on external forensic investigations over the past five financial years; - With a backlog of over R6 billion in outstanding rates and taxes, service delivery is collapsing; - The DA uncovered a billing scandal whereby organised crime syndicates bribe officials in Emfuleni; - Nguna and U-Streets in Emfuleni, which were supposed to have been completed in June 2015, remain untarred– despite the Municipality already paying out R14 million to contractors to upgrade these roads; and - Job creation and local economic development in Emfuleni are at a severe disadvantage as a written reply to DA questions revealed that the municipality owes R121 million in late payments to service providers. The DA proposes that Mayor Khawe: - Rid the municipality of corruption once and for all and take a zero-tolerance stance; - Cut spending on administration, catering and other ‘perks’ for the Executive; - Upgrade the current Billing System to ensure better revenue collection and to improve service delivery; - Fast-track infrastructure projects such as untarred roads and create more EPWP job opportunities for the youth; - Conclude all forensic investigations and release findings thereof to the public; - Ensure payments to local and other service providers are done within 30 days; and - Encourage local investment by supporting small businesses and making use of local suppliers for services rendered. I will write to Mayor Khawe, to request a meeting with him, the Emfuleni Municipal Manager, and the DA Caucus Leadership in council, to propose the above-mentioned solutions. We can work together as political parties to ensure the best possible outcome for the residents of Emfuleni. Emfuleni deserves a new beginning and a turnaround strategy that will see residents benefit from a well-functioning, clean government and responsive government.
