AfriForum places EFF on terms over hate speech 18 January 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum considers laying a complaint of hate speech against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) after EFF protesters yesterday chanted the phrases “White man, you must die”, “Shoot to kill the Boere” and several other racist and inciting remarks during a protest at Hoërskool Overvaal. AfriForum’s legal team will today serve a lawyer’s letter on the leadership of the EFF in which the party is asked to explain their stance on this incident. “If these actions do not comply with EFF policies, we demand that the Party distances itself unconditionally and institutes disciplinary action,” says Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum. “If the Party is however unwilling to do this, AfriForum will lay a complaint of hate speech against the Party in terms of the Equality Act.” Issued by Marelie Greeff, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 18 January 2018
