DA welcomes restart of Eskom Inquiry on Tuesday, 23 January 16 January 2018 The DA welcomes the announcement today that the Parliamentary Inquiry into Eskom is set to resume on Tuesday, 23 January 2018. Former Eskom CFO, Anoj Singh is set to appear before the Inquiry on Tuesday, whilst Mathsela Koko, the former Acting Eskom CEO, is expected to appear on Wednesday, 24 January 2018. Eskom is in crisis and is currently facing major institutional disintegration, financial trouble and gross mismanagement and the situation seems to worsen on a daily basis. It is clear that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to turn things around, not just at the power utility, but also at Prasa, Transnet and Denel, which have all succumbed to state capture. The DA looks forward to working with our colleagues across the political spectrum to ensure that we root out the rot at all our state-owned enterprises (SOE) and ensuring good corporate governance is once again restored. We remain resolute about getting back to the task of exposing the corrupt cabal of Gupta henchmen at all SOE’s, removing them from power and ensuring that they get back to working for the people of this country.
