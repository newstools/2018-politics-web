KZN Transport’s reaction to fatal rock-throwing too little, too late The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KZN has noted with extreme disappointment the haphazard response by the Provincial Department of Transport to the spate of rock-throwing incidents on the N2 over the last two weeks between Tongaat and Ballito, which included the death of two children, Amina Haffejee and her brother, Abdur Raheem. To date, the Police and Provincial authorities have been caught flat-footed, with no clear direction offered while community members have cried out for action and justice. Only now, after extensive media coverage and anger by residents has theTransport MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda, finally been jolted into action. I was informed of a WhatsApp message sent from the department last night, requesting a meeting of stakeholders to be held today in Pietermaritzburg at 10am. It is unacceptable that this meeting request was sent less than 24 hours in advance and that is was only sent to selective people, excluding local councillors in eThekwini and KwaDukuza who have worked to assist law enforcement to find those responsible for the deaths of the children. It is expected that the MEC will make some announcement on Tuesday after the input of this ‘technical team’ however no further clarity has been forthcoming about what exactly will be announced. I would advise the MEC to firstly show compassion to those that have been affected by these incidents and to acknowledge the public anger that exists regarding this issue. Rock-throwing on this stretch of road is not new but authorities have been slow to act. The MEC must then finally table a plan which will seek nothing less than announcing the enclosure of these bridges. Anything short of this will see more lives lost and more damage to vehicles. We need accountability and we need it now. Statement issued by Dean Macpherson, Member of Parliament, 8 January 2018
