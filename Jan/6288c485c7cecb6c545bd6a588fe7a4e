FF Plus learnt with deep regret of Lucas Mangope’s passing The FF Plus learnt, with deep regret, of the death of Mr Lucas Mangope and would like to express their deepest condolences to Mr Mangope’s family and friends, says Dr Pieter Groenewald, leader of the FF Plus. Dr Groenewald says that Mr Mangope, the former leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland, will be remembered for the fervour with which he approached service delivery for his community. The present Provincial Legislature complex in North West, which was previously the governmental offices and parliament of Bophuthatswana, attest to this. “He developed infrastructure and there was a time when Bophuthatswana had an economic boom, specifically relating to factories in the Soshanguve region around Pretoria. “In my personal interaction with Mr Mangope during my two years in the North-West Legislature, I found him to be a dignified leader who commanded respect and who showed respect towards others. “He was also one of the few leaders that prior to 1994 resisted the unconditional incorporation back into South Africa, which eventually occurred with the new dispensation after the 1994 elections. “He knew that the new dispensation would mean a total surrender to the ANC and that it would be to South Africa’s detriment, and that is exactly what happened,” says Dr Groenewald.
