The three officers are suspected to be involved in the alleged murder of journalist Godknows Nare, on 17 April 2017. The officers were involved in a shooting incident which occurred after they responded to a tip-off involving a hijacked vehicle. The JMPD has conducted an internal investigation into the matter and the outcome has been provided to the authorities. We take note of the statement made by IPID about the co-operated arrest and urge investigating authorities to afford the suspects a fair legal process, which includes a fair trial. The Department of Public Safety will comply with the legal process and await the outcome of the court trial. The three suspects will appear in the Roodepoort Magistrate Court, today.
