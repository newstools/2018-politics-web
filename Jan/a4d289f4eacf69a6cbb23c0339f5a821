EFF WELCOMES THE APPOINTMENT OF JABU MABUZA AS ESKOM BOARD CHAIR Sunday, January 21, 2018 The EFF welcomes the appointment of Jabu Mabuza as Eskom board chair. It is indeed the leadership of Jabu Mabuza that brought Telkom to stability and profitability, alongside Sipho Maseko. We express confidence in his demonstrated integrity and track record. We further indicate that he should not be tempted to corrupt the institution, and should act decisively against all corrupt officials. His immediate task and that of the board should be cancellation of the Tegeta Coal deal and a general review all the coal supply deals ESKOM signed under apartheid. His true test will be on the ability to resist Â pressures from corrupt politicians, name and shame them. We also call on him to break with the corporate tendency not to report corruption to law enforcement and immediately, on behalf of Eskom, open criminal cases against all officials, board members, both who are still in the system and the ones that have left. He must do this to help ensure that there are consequences to corruption. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 21 January 2018
