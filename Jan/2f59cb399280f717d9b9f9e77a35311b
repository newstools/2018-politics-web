Bara Hospital without a CEO for two years 15 January 2018 Incidents of poor treatment of patients continue at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital which still does not have a permanent Chief Executive Officer since the previous CEO was removed two years ago by former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu. I have noted the Facebook post by Deputy Social Development Minister Hendrietta Ipeleng Bogopane-Zulu on Saturday this weekend where she mourns the death of her sister “after sitting the whole night at the casualty at Bara without being attended to, despite vomiting, having diarrhoea, to the point of lying there unconscious till she died.” This is tragic and utterly inexcusable, and I extend my deepest condolences to her and her family for this devastating loss. A full investigation is needed into this incident and the general poor service at the hospital, especially in the casualty department which is typically overcrowded. An Acting CEO has been in charge for two years and he is unable to provide the firm leadership that is needed to improve the quality of treatment for patients. The previous CEO, Dr Sandile Mfenyana, was removed in January 2016 without explanation, and a permanent replacement has not been appointed despite promises by Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa. She has said that the CEO position was advertised with a closing date of 15 December 2016 and four applications were received, so what is the reason for such a long delay in making a permanent appointment? A dynamic and competent CEO needs to be appointed as soon as possible to effectively manage the hospital’s R3.5 billion budget and 6000 employees.
