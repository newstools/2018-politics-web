Heads must roll of those responsible for “Captain KGB” long stay in the SAPS 29 January 2018 The DA notes the dismissal of Morris “Captain KGB” Tshabalala from the South African Police Service (SAPS). This is long overdue. Captain KGB should never have been appointed in the first place as a convicted person fleeing from justice. This points to an abysmal failure by the SAPS vetting processes. After being arrested and serving time in prison, he was allowed back on the SAPS payroll. This is a complete and utter failure by the SAPS management to build and run an efficient and professional police service. The dismissal of Captain KGB cannot and should not be the end of the matter but more heads should roll including those responsible for approving Captain KGB’s appointment. This matter shows why the chronically mismanaged SAPS needs a complete overhaul to ensure professionalism. The DA will pose Parliamentary questions to determine whether Captain KGB was ever subjected to a vetting procedure and if so what the outcome of this process was. It is inconceivable how an individual with such a tainted record can be entrusted with a responsibility of enforcing the laws of fighting crime and rooting out unprecedented levels of corruption in this country. The DA will await answers from the SAPS fully explaining how Captain KGB was allowed to stay in the service for so long. If the police leadership was seriously committed to fighting crime, it would not elevate compromised individuals to top positions or install them in sensitive environments who cannot guarantee the safety of many South Africans who live in constant fear in their homes.
