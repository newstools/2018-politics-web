Mbalula must come clean about Mdluli’s golden handshake The DA welcomes the announcement by Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula, that suspended Head of Crime Intelligence Richard Mdluli has finally been fired after he has been on a long seven-year suspension. The national Police Commissioner, General Khehla Sithole confirmed that Mdluli was granted early termination of service and is therefore entitled to the usual benefits associated with. The DA finds it unacceptable that Mdluli has already received R8.3 million over the past 7 years for sitting at home and contributing nothing to the fight against crime in South Africa. The Minister must fully inform the public of the exact financial benefits that will accrue to Mdluli. The DA believes that the public has a right to know these details. If Mdluli’s disciplinary proceedings had been speedily concluded and he had been axed, he would not have been entitled to the benefits that Mbalula has now agreed to grant him. It is totally unacceptable that people who are ill-equipped and compromised to fight crime receive such benefits while our people continue to live under siege because of the high levels of crime in their communities. The Public Service Commission must expeditiously complete their investigation into the seven-year suspension and delay in concluding the disciplinary process against him which they started at the DA’s request in July 2017. South Africans deserve to live in a safe and crime-free society and this can only be ensured by dedicated police who are committed to fighting crime and upholding the rule of law.
