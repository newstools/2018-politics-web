Matric 2017: DA to request visits to most improved and declined schools The DA will today write to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education, Ms Nomalungelo Gina, to request that the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education visit the most improved and most declined schools in South Africa in terms of matric pass rates. Five schools (of 30 or more candidates) have made the greatest strides in improving their pass rates from 2015 to 2017: Province School name 2015 pass rate (%) 2016 pass rate (%) 2017 pass rate (%) Change % 2015-2017 KZN MKHOMBISI HIGH SCHOOL 24.5 37.3 100 75.5 EC TYELINZIMA HIGH SCHOOL 15.6 32.4 88.6 73 EC ZINYOSINI SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL 26.5 62.7 96.2 69.7 KZN MPIKANINA HIGH SCHOOL 24.7 7.1 93.3 68.6 EC HLANGWINI SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL 17.5 53.2 86.5 69 It is important that we understand what has made these schools more successful over time and what insights their leaders can offer to other schools to assist in improving their performance and make sure more students pass. Unfortunately, there are many schools where the pass rate has deteriorated significantly. The five schools were the pass mark has dropped the most from 2015 to 2017 are: Province School name 2015 pass rate (%) 2016 pass rate (%) 2017 pass rate (%) Change % 2015-2017 KZN UMHLOLUTHINI HIGH SCHOOL 84.9 4.2 3.3 -81.6 LP MAMPHODO SECONDARY SCHOOL 95.7 64.9 19 -76.7 KZN ISISUSA SECONDARY 95.5 81.1 26 -69.5 MP BEN W MASHEGO SECONDARY SCHOOL 96.3 47.9 29.8 -66.5 LP RAMOSHOBOHLE HIGH SCHOOL 94.4 63.5 35.7 -58.7 Such a drop in performance is disappointing, and the circumstances leading to the decline must be investigated. It is imperative that we identify and address the challenges facing our schools, rather than wait for second-hand reports from the Department of Basic Education (DBE). The best way to do this is to conduct official oversight visits to these schools as the Committee and to use this experience to better evaluate the policies so we can improve the quality of education our children receive.
