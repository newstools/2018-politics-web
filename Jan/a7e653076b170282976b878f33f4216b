What is happening with first year nurse training in Gauteng? The Gauteng Health Department appears to have backtracked over the cancellation of first year nursing training but there is no clarity as to when classes will start for 700 students who qualified for admission. Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said yesterday that they would postpone the start of first year nursing until money is found for bursaries, accommodation and training material. But last week a Department spokesperson said that nursing classes were cancelled because they were short of R57 million. I sympathize with angry students who gathered yesterday outside the Chris Hani Baragwanath and Ann Latsky nursing colleges. They are victims of poor planning and the ongoing health budget crisis. It is unacceptable that nurse training is disrupted and delayed for students who qualified after a rigorous selection process. Ramokgopa should apologize for this bungle and announce a date when nursing classes will start as soon as possible. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 16 January 2018
