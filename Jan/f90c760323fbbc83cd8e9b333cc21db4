Condolences on the passing of Gerald Morkel 10 January 2018 The Western Cape Government is greatly saddened by the news of the passing of Gerald Morkel, former Premier of the Province and Mayor of Cape Town. Gerald was elected Premier in 1999, and headed the first coalition government in democratic South Africa  --  pioneering a form of government that is now established throughout South Africa. In his capacity as DA leader in the Western Cape, he was on the frontline of some of the party’s toughest survival struggles, when many of his colleagues defected, first to the New National Party, and then to the ANC. History has vindicated his foresight in the decisions he took during that most difficult time. He was a stalwart for the cause, and played a significant role in the development of democracy in South Africa’s early years. Our deep condolences go to his wife Hazel, his sons, and their families.
