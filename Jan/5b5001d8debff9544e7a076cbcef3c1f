ANC IS SHOCKED AND DISMAYED BY THE VICIOUS MURDER OF ITS COUNCILLOR  2 January 2018 The African National Congress (ANC) is appalled by the ferocious murder of its activist and a Ward 02 councillor in Jozini Municipality on the Far North Region yesterday. Cde Njabulo "Jija" Dlamini was stabbed to death unknown assailant while in Richards Bay Beach with the family to celebrate the first day of the New Year. It’s alleged that the man approached Cde Dlamini, asking him to step aside when an argument broke out. Details regarding Cde Dlamini’s murder remain sketchy but it appears that his attacker withdrew a knife and stabbed him before disappearing into the multitude of beachgoers. The ANC is horrified of losing such a young activist loved by the community he served. His untimely passing will leave a void in the ranks of the ANC, the Alliance and the mass democratic movement in general, that will not be easy to fill. As the activist, Cde Dlamini was always available to serve his organisation with high degree. He was a dedicated comrade, and a true revolutionary who served our community with dedication. The ANC was still waiting for a lot from Cde Dlamini as he continued to prove himself as a good leader and family man. We calls on those who might have witnessed this brutal murder to provide police with necessary information that could assist in tracking down this vicious killer to be brought before books. The ANC extend its heartfelt condolences to Cde Dlamini’s family, comrades and friends. We would like to assure them that we are with them during this sad moment of bereavement and will do everything in our power to ensure that perpetrators pay for their sins.
