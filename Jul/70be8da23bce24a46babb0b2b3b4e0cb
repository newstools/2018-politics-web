FF Plus supports the pro-Israel march to the Union Buildings 26 July 2018 The FF Plus backs the march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, which was organised by the group South African Friends of Israel to show support for Israel. Some of the demands that the marchers made was that South Africa’s ambassador must be reinstated in Israel and that relationships between South Africa and Israel must be normalised. The FF Plus strongly condemns the fact that the ANC government openly sided with the Palestinians on this sensitive matter. The government is supposed to know better as the Israel-Palestine issue is extremely complex and both sides have the right to self-determination. The South African government will do well to support this outcome and maintain a balanced attitude towards the respective groups. The ANC government cannot openly side with the Palestinians while Hamas keeps saying that Israel must be destroyed. South Africa can benefit from a normalised relationship with Israel seeing as Israel possesses expertise in various fields – in water technology, for instance, which is something that is vital for South Africa. The time has come for the South African government to reconsider its neutrality with regard to the Israel-Palestine issue and to heed the call to reinstate an ambassador in Israel.
