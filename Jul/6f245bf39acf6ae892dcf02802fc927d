Work stoppages symptomatic of Gauteng Health crisis 23 July 2018 Gauteng state hospitals have been hit by 3639 work stoppages since September last year, but the Gauteng Health Department has still not negotiated an essential services agreement with unions to ensure that patients are not adversely affected by strikes. This is revealed by Acting Gauteng Health MEC, Faith Mazibuko, in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. According to Mazibuko, 268 workers downed tools at 33 health facilities on 27 September last year, and the only action taken against them was leave without pay. Work stoppages have jumped dramatically this year, with the following incidents involving 3371 workers: - Kopanong Hospital on 16 March - 42 workers- Thelle Mogoerane Hospital on 31 May - 500 workers- Sterkfontein Hospital on 28 May - 600 staff- Leratong Hospital on 30 May - 1600 workers- Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital (CMJH) on 16 March - 120 workers- CMJH on 19-24 April - 100 workers- CMJH on 25 April - 109 workers- CMJH on 29-30 May - 300 workers Mazibuko says that disciplinary processes are under way for the April-May disturbances this year. With regard to an essential services agreement, she says “the Department and the unions are negotiating at Public Sector Coordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC) and are currently convening the Provincial workshop to orientate the Province of the status.” The Department has been inexcusably slow in concluding an essential services agreement so that patients are not harmed when strikes occur. Meanwhile, tough disciplinary action should be taken against any hospital staff who endanger patients such as the disgraceful violence and trashing that occurred at CMJH twice this year. This sharp increase in industrial action at Gauteng hospitals is largely caused by the gross mismanagement which has left our Gauteng Health Department in crisis. Premier David Makhura has ignored this crisis for far too long, and it is high time that he intervenes before the public health sector in this province is beyond repair.
