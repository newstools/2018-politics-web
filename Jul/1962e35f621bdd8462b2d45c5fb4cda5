FF Plus leads delegation to speak to Swazi king about land 25 July 2018 On invitation of King Mswati III of Swaziland, the FF Plus will tomorrow head a delegation of various groups who intend to engage in talks with the king about land in South Africa that farmers obtained lawfully from the Swazis by means of historical agreements. The land in question extends over nearly the entire surface area of the province of Mpumalanga and according to available historical documents, the land was obtained from the then Swazi king through bartering with, among other things, livestock. Mr Werner Weber, the FF Plus provincial leader in Mpumalanga, will head the delegation. He will be accompanied by adv Anton Alberts, chairperson of the FF Plus. The rest of the delegation consists of, among others, senior office bearers from AfriForum, the Afrikanerbond and TAU SA. The aim with the talks is to reconfirm the historical agreements between the Swazis and farmers and to make the message to the ANC loud and clear: it is a malicious myth that all the land in South Africa was stolen from black people. The conversation with the king will take place at the King’s Lozitha palace just outside Lobamba, where the Swazi parliament is situated. (Directions are attached herewith). The talks will commence at 14:00 and will be followed by a media conference. People who are interested are welcome to contact Mr Weber. (Contact details below).
