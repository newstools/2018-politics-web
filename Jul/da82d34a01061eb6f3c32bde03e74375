Solidarity triumphs as Court invalidates appointments policy 5 July 2018 Trade union today obtained a favourable ruling in the protracted SARIPA lawsuit when the Constitutional Court found for Solidarity by ruling that the random application of affirmative action must come to an end. The lawsuit was the result of an appointments policy instituted by the Minister of Justice and the Master of the High Court according to which the appointment of liquidators has to be based on the grounds of race only. “With this case we have drawn a line in the sand, saying: Enough is enough! This race-obsessed approach, instead of a more inclusive and nuanced approach based on merit and training, was not good for the country and its citizens,” Anton van der Bijl, Head of Solidarity’s Labour Law Division said. Solidarity will issue a further statement as soon as the judgment has been studied. Issued by Anton van der Bijl, Head of Labour Law Services, Solidarity, 5 July 2018
