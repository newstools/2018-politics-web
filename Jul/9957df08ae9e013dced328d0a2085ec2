Infant mortality at Pelonomi Regional Hospital three times higher than national average 24 July 2018 The infant mortality rate at the Pelonomi Regional Hospital in Bloemfontein, Free State, is almost three times higher than the national average. Stats SA recorded the national infant mortality rate in its Midyear Population Estimates report released yesterday to be at 36,4 deaths per 1 000 live births (3.6%). During a recent DA oversight inspection to the Pelonomi Regional Hospital, it was revealed that the infant mortality rate for the Maternity Ward has skyrocketed from 7.3% in 2017 to 11.2% in 2018. The Maternity Ward has been plagued by severe staff shortages, lack of equipment and access to theatres. The theatres in this ward has been under renovation since 2015, and we could not get any indication from the hospital management when the theatres would again be operational. Currently the Maternity Ward is making use of the hospital’s general theatres for caesareans and obstetrics and gynaecology (OB/GYN), which is quite some distance from the Maternity Ward. The DA will once the Legislature reconvenes from the constituency period, request the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Social Services, to call the Free State Department of Health to brief the committee on the causes of each infant death recorded at this ward during the last two years and what urgent measures will be implemented to drastically reduce the high infant mortality rate at this hospital. The DA suspect that many of these infant deaths could have been avoided had the Maternity Ward the necessary qualified staff competent, access to fully equipped and functional theatres close to the ward, and an effective after-birth care system.
