Thales’s position following the decision of the National Director of Public Prosecutions in South Africa on July, 25, 2018 25 July 2018 Thales notes the decision by the National Director of Public Prosecutions on 25 July 2018 to reject its representations in respect of its prosecution in South Africa. Thales intends to consider all legal options available to it under South African law in order to present its defense to the charges in this procedure commenced as far back as 2006. Bearing in mind the very long delay of this procedure – through no fault of Thales at all – together with a range of factors beyond its control, Thales believes it cannot obtain a fair trial, as it is entitled to under the South-African Constitution and international law. Thales reiterates that it has no knowledge of any transgressions having been committed by any of its employees in relation to the awarding of the contract for the combat systems for South Africa's corvettes (the Arms Deal in 1999). Thales respects the law, has a zero-tolerance policy on corruption and has cooperated fully with the local authorities at all times, and will continue to do so. Issued by Thales, 27 July 2018
