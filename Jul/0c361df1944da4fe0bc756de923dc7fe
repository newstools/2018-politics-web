Resignation of ANC MP Mduduzi Manana 25 July 2018 The Office of the ANC Chief Whip confirms the resignation of comrade Mduduzi Manana as a member of Parliament. The letter received by the Office, dated 24 July 2018, states comrade Manana’s voluntary withdrawal of membership from the National Assembly with immediate effect. Comrade Manana joined the National Assembly in 2009 and served in the Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements at the time of his resignation. He had previously served on the Portfolio Committee on International Relations & Cooperation, and the Public Works Portfolio Committee when he joined Parliament in 2009. He was later appointed as Whip of the Portfolio Committee on Transport in 2011 and was thereafter deployed to the Executive as Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training – a position he resigned from in 2017. His voluntary resignation from Parliament, coupled with his resignation from the Executive in 2017, is indicative of someone who has taken full responsibility and has shown remorse for his actions relating to his involvement in a gender-based violence case where a court of law found him guilty. We further note his public statement to the effect of actively participating in campaigns and initiatives to fight any form of gender-based violence and these initiatives have our full support. We wish comrade Manana well with all his future endeavours. Issued by the Office of the ANC Chief Whip, Hon. Jackson Mthembu, 25 July 2018
