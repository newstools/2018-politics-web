ANC welcomes Minister Cele's successful interventions in Hermanus 26 July 2018 ANC welcomes National Governments interventions in Hermanus, led by Minister Bheki Cele which have overcome failures of local government in fair distribution of municipal services and other human settlement needs. Minister Cele's intervention have brought much needed stability in the area which gives an opportunity for the failures to be rectified. We also welcome his commitments to facilitate a joint intergovernmental forum with different departments such as COGTA, Human Settlement and Social Development. He has also promised to pay a visit to the arrested leaders and engage them. As the ANC we have reprimanded the DA government, both at local and provincial government, for seeking to Police communities social ills and Militarize bread and butter issues. Our people are unemployed, have no decent shelter, no water and sanitation and it is not clear how an army of police and military will resolve these social challenges. The ANC is not in government in Hermanus or in Western Cape but it is clear that we cannot rely on the DA government to care about pro-poor and pro-black issues. We must therefore work tirelessly in making sure that our structures are the ones to take on issues of our people and find answers to avoid such occurrences. We therefore ask the national government to undertake to visit the broader Overstrand Municipality again to make sure that we work on a plan to change our people's lives for the better. The DA is clearly not a leader of this society. Issued by Faiez Jacobs, Provincial Secretary, ANC Western Cape, 26 July 2018
