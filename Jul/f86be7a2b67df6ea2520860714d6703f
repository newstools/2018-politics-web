AfriForum intensifies safety measures in Pretoria during power outages 19 July 2018 Large parts of Pretoria were left without electricity for the past couple of weeks after the Wapadrand substation burnt down. This led to an increase in crime, which compelled AfriForum to intensify safety measures in these areas. AfriForum neighbourhood watches have executed more visibility patrols since the power outages. An external security company (Hi Risk Unit) since 16 July also offered additional security to residents at AfriForum’s request. “The community already suffers enough due to power outages and ought not face an increase in crime as well. AfriForum’s safety division would like to support the community to the best of our ability and visibility patrols such as these is a good way to deter criminals,” says Hillel Coetzer, AfriForum’s Safety Coordinator for the northern region. “We have the community’s best interest at heart and know that it is important that stakeholders work together to fight crime,” says Reg Crewe from the Hi Risk Unit.
