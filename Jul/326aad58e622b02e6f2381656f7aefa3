Gold producers offer pittance or insulting wage increases 18 July 2018 The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has noted the pittance or insulting wage offers from the gold producers tabled today.  They had offered annual wage increases of up to R550 to miners and up to 4.5 percent for artisans, miners, and officials. These wage offers are not even close to what our members are demanding. The gold producers have been very arrogant in their approach to this wage negotiations to the extent that their offer on the table smacks of insults and arrogance. We will take this pittance or insulting wage offer back to our members for them to make a final decision. All the stakeholders will reconvene next week Wednesday and the unions will report back to the plenary the mandate from the members. The NUM is still demanding R9 500 for the surface workers, R10 500 for the underground and 15% for the artisans, miners, and officials.
