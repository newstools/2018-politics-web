STATEMENT BY MR MDUDUZI MANANA The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) has informed me Of its decision to decline to prosecute on the assault case which my former domestic worker had opened against me at the Douglasdale Police Station. I need to reiterate that the allegations against me were obviously frivolous and were rooted in a politically motivated smear campaign against me by my political opponents. I welcome the decision of the NPA which has cleared me of any wrong doing and feel totally exonerated. Though there have been mounting pressure for me to step down as a member of parliament, felt that this would have been a premature step as the matter was still being investigated by law enforcement agencies and it would have most likely amounted to admission of guilt. Now that the NPA has independently decided that I have no case to answer based on the police investigation, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw my membership from the National Assembly after almost 10 years Of active participation in parliamentary politics. This will give me ample time to focus my renewed energies on the work of my political organization ahead of the 2019 General Elections, my academic commitments and my business interests. In this connection, I have decided to heed the rallying call by the President Of the Republic of South Africa, H.E Cyril Ramaphosa, to lend a hand by donating a portion of my pension as follows: - R1000 000 to Khuluma Ndoda (a Men's Social Movement against all types of Gender Based Violence) led by Mr. Patrick Shai under the 'Thuma Mina Men Against GBV Fund' which Will focus and deal with (a) social factors influencing boy child perceptions on Gender Based Violence and (b) rural men Who are real custodians of patriarchy and who tend to export patriarchal behaviour and turn it into lifestyle when they migrate to urban and metropolitan areas. The fund will be officially launched on the 1st Of August 2018 in Johannesburg; - R500 000 to the Nceduluntu Youth Foundation 'OneMiIIionPadsâ€™ campaign which will assist the organization in its quest to restore the Of the African girl child through the distribution of sanitary and dignity packs to twelve (12) identified schools over a period of three (3) years; and - Scholarship opportunities to five (5) male students to enrol at the University of South Africa (UNISA) for postgraduate programmes in Gender Studies in order to increase their capacity to analyse and critically reflect on their personal/ local gender relations with the aim of engaging With the wider community as change agents for greater gender equality. In conclusion, I wish to indicate that the issue of Sexual/ Gender Based Violence is very serious as evidenced by the reaction of South Africans following my previous case of assault, for which took full responsibility, and therefore must not be used to (a) advance selfish & narrow political ends and (b) solicit financial benefit by making false accusations as that would a vicious assault on the efforts, for which have now dedicated myself to, of eliminating Gender based Violence wherever it manifest itself.
