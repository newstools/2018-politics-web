Expropriation without compensation: The promise of prosperity and economic success that will never materialise 29 July 2018 Solidarity today at die Heartfelt Arena in Pretoria made a submission to the panel facilitating the countrywide public participation process. The essence of Solidarity’s input to the panel is twofold: Firstly, Solidarity is of the opinion that the support proponents of expropriation without compensation (EWC) enjoy, is based on the promises that are associated with it. Those promises are that the EWC will bring prosperity and economic success. For this reason, it is important to point out that EWS is not so much about the desire to cultivate the land but rather that it is seen as a vehicle that would lead to prosperity and economic success. In the second place, Solidarity contends that a pragmatic view of EWC is called for. Solidarity’s Deputy Chief Executive Werner Human, who made a submission to the public hearing, contends that history has already judged EWC, that EWC has no economic benefit and, should it materialise in one way or the other, it would be to the detriment of all South Africa’s citizens. “Solidarity states unequivocally that expropriation without compensation would be disastrous for the country’s economy and moreover that, should it succeed, South Africa will go back in time,” Werner Human, Solidarity’s deputy chief operations officer for Legal Services said. “The way in which the complex issue of land needs to be dealt with is rather to expand private ownership, for it has already been proven that ownership leads to economic growth and prosperity,” Human added.
