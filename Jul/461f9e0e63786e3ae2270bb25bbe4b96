Grace Mugabe’s diplomatic immunity set aside 30 July 2018 The South Gauteng High Court today found that the former Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane’s, decision to grant Grace Mugabe diplomatic immunity, should be set aside. AfriForum, Gabriella Engels and various other parties brought the rescission application in this regard. Judge Bashier Vally, who in May heard arguments in the application for the review and rescission of the Minister’s decision to grant diplomatic immunity to Ms. Mugabe, found that the Minister’s decision was unconstitutional and that she is responsible for AfriForum and Engels’ legal costs. “We welcome the judgement. This decision paves the way for the institution of criminal prosecution steps against Ms. Mugabe after she last year assaulted and seriously injured Engels, a Johannesburg model, with an extension cord. AfriForum believes that the National Prosecuting Authority should act in this regard, but if not Adv. Gerrie Nel and AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit are at the ready to privately prosecute Mugabe,” says Willie Spies, AfriForum and Engels’ legal representative.
