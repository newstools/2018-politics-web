Ramaphosa’s explanation on transferring compromised Arthur Fraser does not hold up 19 July 2018 The DA maintains that the President’s decision to appoint the compromised former Head of the State Security Agency, Arthur Fraser, to the position of National Commissioner of Correctional Services was unconstitutional, irrational and should be reviewed and set aside. President Ramaphosa’s explanation that his decision was made to avoid a “constitutional crisis” does not hold up and is unsatisfactory. The President apparently agreed with the Minister of State Security, Ms Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba’s, assessment that Mr Fraser’s “strong personality would not be conducive to the investigation of an independent” panel, set up to investigate why the State Security Agency was not functionally effectively. However, this does not mean that the President should then transfer Mr Fraser to another position which requires an individual that is above reproach. The serious allegations against Fraser include that he operated a secret and parallel intelligence service from his own home while working for the State Security Agency (SSA) and utilised millions of rands of public funds for personal gain. The Department of Correctional Services has struggled for some time to function efficiently or effectively. The DA is of the belief that the appointment of Fraser as the National Commissioner will do nothing to improve the departments functioning. The DA will continue with our application to the Pretoria High Court seeking an order declaring that the President’s appointment of Mr Fraser violated the President’s constitutional obligation to appoint a National Commissioner who is sufficiently conscientious, has enough credibility to do this important job effectively and is of good character.
