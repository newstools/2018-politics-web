DA welcomes charges of corruption against Dudzane Zuma We welcome the fact that Duduzane Zuma has finally been charged with corruption for his alleged role in trying to bribe former Deputy Minister of Finance Mcebsi Jonas in 2015. We laid the charges of corruption against Atul Gupta, Ajay Gupta and Duduzane Zuma, in terms of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act (No. 12 of 2004), on 17 March 2016 at a police station in Cape Town [CAS 1200/3/2016]. We did so following a public statement by the former Deputy Minister of Finance, Mcebisi Jonas, on 16 March 2016, where he alleged that members of the Gupta family had offered him the position of Finance Minister, prior to the firing of the former Minister of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene, on 09 December 2015. We hope that once this matter has been fully investigated that Atul Gupta and Ajay Gupta will also be charged with corruption for their alleged role in trying to bribe former Deputy Minister of Finance Mcebisi Jonas in 2015. We would be in a very different place today has the alleged plot to capture National Treasury succeeded in South Africa. Statement issued by David Maynier MP, DA Shadow Minister of Finance, 9 July 2018
