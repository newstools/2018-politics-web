Dagada’s resignation as DA Member premature The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes Dr. Rabelani Dagada’s decision to resign from the DA with immediate effect. Dr. Dagada states that his resignation was not voluntary but necessitated by the circumstances, namely a "political witch-hunt". We find this perplexing as all disciplinary processes initiated against Dr. Dagada were suspended, in light of the High Court judgement handed down in the Patricia de Lille matter regarding the constituting of the Federal Legal Commission. We regret that Dr. Dagada has pre-empted any internal disciplinary outcomes that would have resulted from a full and thorough investigation of the charges against him, which include the serious charge of bringing the Party into disrepute. During Dr. Dagada’s seven year tenure as a DA member, he served on the Johannesburg Regional Executive Committee, Gauteng Provincial Executive Committee and the Federal Committee. Considering this record of service, it is disappointing that Dr. Dagada has chosen to leave the Party under these circumstances. We however wish Dr. Dagada all the best in his future endeavours.
