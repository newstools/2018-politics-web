AfriForum ready to privately prosecute Jiba According to AfriForum, today’s judgement in the Highest Court of Appeal which overturns the ruling that Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwerbi of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) should be removed from the role of advocates, will not be an obstacle in the presumed criminal charges against Jiba. “AfriForum will proceed at full capacity with the process to privately prosecute Jiba. The NPA now has no reason not to make a decision regarding AfriForum’s application for a nolle prosequicertificate,” says Monique Taute, Head of AfriForum’s Anti-Corruption Unit. AfriForum earlier announced that the civil rights organisation will implement private prosecution against Jiba. “It is now even more vital that Jiba is criminally prosecuted. The NPA’s answer to our request for a nolle prosequi certificate was that they will base their decision pending the judgement of today’s appeal process. The NPA now has no choice other than to announce their decision regarding the reinstitution of Jiba’s prosecution. If the NPA decides not to prosecute, AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit is at the ready to privately prosecute her,” says Taute.
