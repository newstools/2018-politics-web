AfriForum presently 210 000 members strong 25 July 2018 The civil rights organisation AfriForum’s active membership just surpassed the 210 000 notch. This organisation’s membership was only 9 000 at the beginning of 2010 and subsequently grew by more than 2 300% over the last eight and a half years. According to Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, it is especially informative that the organisation is displaying strong growth despite attempts from certain circles to make misrepresentations about AfriForum and to try and hang false etiquettes round the organisation’s neck. “Normal, moderate people that want to make a positive contribution seemingly increasingly support this organisation amid unfair attacks on AfriForum.” Kriel emphasises that the strong growth in AfriForum’s membership means that the organisation can enter a new phase and expand its operations and campaigns even further. “The support of the 210 000 members makes it possible, among others, to further expand Adv. Gerrie Nel’s team at AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit to tackle more cases. AfriForum is also presently capable of further expanding its network of approximately 110 neighbourhood watches and other do-it-yourself actions in local communities, while the organisation’s national and international campaigns can be tackled on an even bigger scale,” adds Kriel. Kriel highlights that AfriForum’s campaigns are made possible by members and that each of the 210 000 members can be proud of their own role in the successes that AfriForum has already achieved and will still achieve in future. “AfriForum’s strength lies in its members and that is why AfriForum would like to thank each of its members for their continuous support.” According to Kriel, AfriForum’s 210 000 members supply the organisation with the necessary muscular strength to perform its role as civil rights watchdog and do-it-yourself organisation with greater efficiency, while the constantly growing membership will also ensure that this strength will only increase in future.
