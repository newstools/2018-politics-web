Evaton Renewal Project: ANC government wastes millions on 31 houses when 102 could’ve been built 5 July 2018 The DA is shocked to learn that the ANC-led Emfuleni Local Municipality has spent over R12 million in building 22 temporary relocation villages and 9 show villages. This was revealed by Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) MEC, Uhuru Moiloa, in a written reply to DA questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. According to the MEC, the municipality contracted one service provider to construct temporary accommodation facilities to be used as a decanting instrument. 22 houses were built and the service provider was paid R7 886 438. The same service provider was paid R4 392 762 for the construction of 9 various housing typologies to be used as templates for housing developments. In total the service provider was paid R12 279 200 for construction of 31 houses. The cost of each house built amounts to R369 103.22 while the average cost per RDP house is R120 000 which means that this money could have been used to build about 102 houses instead of the 31 houses. This forms part of the R206 842 207.00 spent on the Evaton Renewal Project that MEC Moiloa can account for. There remains a challenge of identifying what the unaccounted R500 million has been spent on. This money could have been used to build numerous RDP houses since the inception of the Evaton Renewal Project in 2004. The ANC cares little about the dire need for dignified housing by our people. The Gauteng housing waiting list has reached over a million and with the ANC-led government continuing to allow the looting of public funds, the waiting list will continue to grow. The DA is the only party that can bring about Change. We will ensure that public funds are used wisely to restore dignity to our people.
