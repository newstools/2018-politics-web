DA welcomes judgement against eThekwini Mayor 2 June 2018 The Democratic Alliance is satisfied with the ruling by the High Court in Durban against eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede, for her irresponsible comments before the ‘Zuma Must Fall March’ held in Durban last year. The court ruled that Mayor Gumede must be held personally liable for the order handed down by the court. Shortly before the ‘Zuma Must Fall March’ held in April last year, which saw thousands of Durban residents taking to the streets to show their dissatisfaction against former president Zuma, Mayor Gumede threatened protesters that if they turned up to the march they would be arrested by the police. The DA then successfully sought an urgent interdict against Gumede which prevented her from making any further such comments. What is significant in this case, is the fact that government leaders and politicians can no longer make irresponsible remarks on a public platform and use taxpayers’ money to defend themselves in court. This should be a lesson to ANC politicians and the DA will continue to ensure that we will hold them accountable for their words and actions in their personal capacity.
