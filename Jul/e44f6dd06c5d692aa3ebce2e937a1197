Former DA councillor found guilty of fraud in housing deal Former DA councilor Wilma Brady was found guilty of fraud and contravening the Public Finance Management Act on Wednesday. Brady appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Bellville, in the Western Cape, over her illegal authorisation of the construction of houses on provincial land. Brady was accused of acting contrary to the tendering process and acting outside the scope of her duties when she purported to represent the Western Cape housing department. She entered into an agreement with Lelethu Properties and Development, a construction company, to build low-cost houses in the Blue Downs area of the Western Cape. The State alleged that Brady made oral misrepresentations to Lelethu's Faizel Davids in September 2006. Brady allegedly provided Davids with a document in December 2006 which looked like a letter of appointment, dated December 22, 2006. Out on warning Part of the letter said: "... it is further confirmed that I, Wilma Brady, chairperson: Oostenberg subcouncil 21, on behalf of the provincial housing department, appointed Lelethu Properties and Development to develop the serviced land as set out above." Prosecutor Ezmeralda Johnson argued that Brady "acted outside the scope of her duties and/or purported to bind the provincial housing department in a contract which did not comply with the requirements [according to the Procurement Policy Framework Act]". After a lengthy trial, Brady was convicted on Wednesday for fraud and contravening the Public Finance Management Act. Provincial National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Brady would be sentenced on August 17, 2018. She is out on warning pending her sentencing. News24
