Capitec disputes fee probe allegations 3 July 2018 Capitec Bank has taken note of the blatant, misleading and untruthful media commentary by Bloomberg News service. This storyline has now also been repeated by other news organisations that feed from Bloomberg’s distribution. We have no knowledge of the investigation Bloomberg refers to and are in close and regular contact with SARB and the NCR. Questions regarding why Bloomberg would want to mislead viewers and readers through fake news must be directed to them. Issued by Charl Nel, Head of Communications, Capitec Bank, 3 July 2018
