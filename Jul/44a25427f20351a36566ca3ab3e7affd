NUM demands that Eskom pay workers their bonuses 29 July 2018 The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) calls on Eskom to pay bonuses to its employees who had performed exceptionally well.  We remain adamant that the bonus payment is a deal breaker.  Without a bonus, there will be no agreement as per our member’ mandate. As the NUM we demand that Eskom pay the hard working workers who averted load shading their bonuses. As it is reflected in the performance score sheet that workers performed exceptionally well. The EBITDA of R45.4 billion as compared to R37.5 billion of 2017 reflects a healthy increase of 21.1%. The Eskom performance scorecard indicates that workers performed exceptionally well, workers, therefore, deserve bonuses.    The performance contract as presented on 30th May 2018 has only one qualifier which is EBITDA. There other two qualifiers have been sneaked in by “the Thuma Mina brigade” through the back door as a cost-cutting measure. A formal performance contract cannot be changed unilaterally. The NUM will not take this manipulation lightly.  The NUM is going to fight tough and nail until our members get the well-deserved bonuses.
