ANC calls for urgent resolution to the West Coast rock lobster allocation of quotas ANC in the Western Cape calls for a speedy resolution to the rock lobster allocation quotas in the West Coast. These legal entanglements, whether they are between DAFF and big commercial companies or environmentalist are negatively affecting the small scale fisheries and livelihoods of communities who depend on these allocations for survival. As the ANC, we understand the goal of DAFF to be primarily transformation and we reject any tactics to retain an untenable status quo of dominance and monopolies by Big Commercial interests through a manipulation by environmentalist in the name of sustainability. We believe that DAFF must do all it can to ensure this industry is sustainable for many years to come but this must never be used to exclude black commercial fisheries. DAFF must meet all the interested parties, including the environmental group WWF, who are currently taking DAFF to court over these allocations, to urgently resolve all matters without a protracted and prolonged legal process. Statement issued by Faiez Jacobs, Western Cape Provincial Secretary, 16 July 2018
