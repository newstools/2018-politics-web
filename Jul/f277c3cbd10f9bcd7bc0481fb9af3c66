ANC STATEMENT ON THE SUMMARY DISMISSAL OF MR ERROL VELILE PRESENT The African National Congress, today, theÂ 18th of July 2018, served Mr Errol Velile Present with a letter of summary dismissal from its employ following his arrest and appearance in court on allegations of a number of heinous crimes. The ANC expects from its members and employees to respect the laws of the land and not be involved in any criminal activity. The allegations for which Mr Errol Velile Present was arrested for and the charges proffered against him are of serious nature that the organisation had to exercise rules provided for in the ANC Personnel Manual, terminating his service with immediate effect. Mr Errol Velile Present was further informed that in his capacity as a member of the ANC, the organisation will immediately institute disciplinary proceedings against him, in accordance with Rule 25 of the ANC constitution and that in accordance with Rule 25.56 and Rule 25.57 accorded him an opportunity to indicate reasons why the organisation should not immediately exercise its rights to temporarily suspend his membership of the ANC pending the outcomes of the disciplinary proceedings The ANC applauds the SAPS for the swift action taken to apprehend the suspects and urge responsible South Africans to cooperate and report all forms of criminality regardless of who is involved to the law enforcement agencies. ANC STATEMENT ON ALLEGATIONS THAT ONE OF ITS EMPLOYEES IS INVOLVED IN CRIMINALITY The African National Congress is dismayed by the fact that one of its employees was arrested and appeared in court allegedly for involvement in serious crimes. Crime remains a serious cancer in our young democracy, and we must continue to fight it in whatever of its manifestations. We support the efforts by the law enforcement agencies to investigate, arrest and charge perpetrators to such high priority crimes. The ANC on its part is following its internal disciplinary policy for employees, and will ensure that appropriate action is taken.
