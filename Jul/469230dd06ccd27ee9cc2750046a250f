SAPS not doing enough to curb Cash-in-transit heists 5 July 2018 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is deeply concerned about the rise in cash-in-transit heists in the province, despite the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele announcing that stringent measures have been put in place to curb this scourge. These attempts have not yielded positive results. The police's intelligence on the way in which these crimes are orchestrated is weak at best. This follows many recent incidents of cash-in-transit heists with the latest occurring today near Atlas Road and North Rand Road in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. It has been reported that one suspect was shot dead. Two security guards and one bystander were injured. It is clear that cash-in-transit heists are becoming more violent, as these criminals become more desperate. Questions need to be asked about who is supplying these criminals with military grade explosives and ammunition. The manner in which these attacks have occurred indicates that the perpetrators have access to inside information. There are claims that in all these incidents police don’t arrive timeously at the scene. We call on the Gauteng Premier, David Makhura to engage with the both the Gauteng SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange and their national counterparts, Minister of police to find a holistic approach to effectively clamp down on the plague of cash-in-transit heists in the province and to rid SAPS of whatever elements may be fueling these attacks. Under a DA government , the police service will be professionalised and make use of crime intelligence and technology which will greatly assist in the war on crime.
