150 000 more people unemployed under the ANC is a humanitarian crisis 31 July 2018 The increase in unemployment to 27.2% revealed today in StatsSA’s Quarterly Labour Force Survey is nothing short of a humanitarian crisis. Expanded unemployment figures now stand at a staggering 9.634 million, up by 154 000 from the first quarter, with the manufacturing sector hardest hit with 105 000 job losses. Each of the 9.6 million unemployed South Africans represent tens of millions of people who are dependent on their ability to earn a living. As a result of this, our country is facing an unprecedent humanitarian crisis. The youth remain the hardest hit by joblessness, with 67.1% of the 15-24 year-old bracket and 43.2% of the 25-34 year-old bracket unemployed. The fact that South Africa’s youth segment of the labour force is largely unemployed is an indictment on the ANC government’s inability to manage our economy. Furthermore, rampant corruption, maladministration and policy uncertainly has directly led to this jobs bloodbath. The DA has repeatedly called for and proposed youth employment initiatives, as well as sectoral minimum wages, as we firmly believe these policies will save and create more jobs. Considering this dire situation, it is time that the ANC takes accountability for the crisis they have plunged the country into. What South Africa needs is a party that will put its people first and ensure that we cultivate an environment for job creation. The DA is the only party with a credible plan for lifting millions of South Africans out of unemployment and poverty. Voting the ANC out in 2019 is the only way of ensuring more people have fair access to jobs. Issued by Michael Bagraim, DA Shadow Minister of Labour, 31 July 2018
