SANDF confirms border operations are under-resourced 31 July 2018 Today’s announcement by the head of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) that the army does not have the resources to secure our borders is of great concern. General Solly Shoke today admitted at a press conference in Pretoria that the SANDF does not have the resources or adequate equipment to secure the country’s borders, admitting that our porous borders are not under our military’s control. The issue of border security is not just about the number of soldiers deployed at the border but about the broader resource problem which they face. The DA has long held that the ANC government is incapable of dealing decisively with illegal immigration and General Shoke has confirmed this today. This critical shortcoming means that little is being done about cross-border crime and illegal immigration, and General Shoke’s apparent lack of urgency in addressing this problem is unacceptable. President Ramaphosa, as Commander-in-Chief of the SANDF, together with his Cabinet and generals, must present a plan of action detailing the steps that are being taken to strengthen the army’s capacity to protect the people of South Africa. We call upon the ANC government to urgently make a public statement on our porous borders. While billions of rands continue to be wasted on zombie state-owned enterprises, we must rethink our priorities and ensure investment into the SANDF so that we can secure our borders. We cannot afford further delays, and we cannot afford to leave our borders unguarded. The DA will continue to work tirelessly on the security of our national borders, to protect our nation, to combat illegal immigration and to put an end to cross-border crime.
