AfriForum shares Zulu king’s sentiment regarding expropriation without compensation 5 July 2018 AfriForum shares King Goodwill Zwelithini’s sentiment regarding the expropriation of property without compensation and the civil rights organisation is willing to work with all role-players that take a stance against this proposed policy. This follows King Zwelithini’s threat yesterday concerning the secession of Zululand if the policy of expropriation without compensation is implemented. “This policy does not only contain destructive consequences for the economy, but is also a threat to cultural conservation and local communities. AfriForum’s stance has always been that the decentralisation of political power in favour of local communities is a more sustainable solution for South Africa and the retention of cultural diversity. Expropriation without compensation will achieve exactly the opposite,” says Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum. Issued by Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO, AfriForum, 5 July 2018
