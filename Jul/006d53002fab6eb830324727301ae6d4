AfriForum audits landfill sites in Vaal Triangle and West Rand AfriForum audited landfill sites in the Vaal Triangle and West Rand this month as part of the civil rights organisation’s annual landfill site audit campaign during which landfill sites in towns where AfriForum has established branches are audited based on 33 questions. AfriForum concluded that urgent changes will have to be implemented at certain municipalities to ensure that landfill sites adhere to legislation. According to applicable legislation and regulations, among which the National Environmental Management: Waste Act, 2008 (Act No. 59 of 2008), a landfill site must adhere to set requirements for access control and regulations on illegal dumping, fencing and rehabilitation, as well as fire regulations. A landfill site must achieve 80% to pass AfriForum’s audit. Dewet Ungerer, AfriForum’s District Coordinator for the Vaal Triangle and West Rand, says that those landfill sites that achieved less than 80% should be brought up to standard and that municipalities should start taking responsibility for waste management. “Poorly managed landfill sites have a negative impact on the environment as well as the community. It is also the community’s responsibility to place increased pressure on municipalities if landfill sites do not adhere to legislation.” Ungerer also stated that some landfill sites did indeed pass the audit with distinction. “Meyerton for example achieved 96%. It is a good example of how a landfill site ought to be managed.” The towns achieved the following percentages: Town Municipality Licence number 2017 2018 Vereeniging (Sonlandpark Transfer Station) Emfuleni LM   8% Vanderbijlpark Emfuleni LM - 28% 38% Meyerton Midvaal LM 002/12-13/W0001 96% 96% Westonaria (Libanon) Rand West City LM 16/2/7/C231/D21/Z 47% 9% Robinson Ekurhuleni LM 16/2/7/C221/D11/22/P22  92% Randfontein Rand West City LM B33/2/323/34/P12 33% 26% Heidelberg Lesedi LM - 18% 30% AfriForum will continuously monitor the process to ensure that landfill sites that fell short are brought up to standard.
