NO REASON TO BE SATISFIED There is no reason for government to be satisfied and there is no reason for farmers to be content. This warning comes from Mr Henry Geldenhuys, Deputy TAU SA President and Chairman of the union’s Safety and Security Committee as a follow-up on TAU SA’s announcement of attack and murder figures for the first six months of the year. Between January and June, 206 farm attacks and 33 murders occurred according to TAU SA figures. This shows an improvement when compared to last years’ announcement for the same period when 220 attacks and 44 murders were recorded. “As long as a zero figure is not recorded, we have no reason to be happy”, says Mr Geldenhuys. “Every life is important, and every murder is one too many. Government cannot afford to sit back and be content, purely because the 2018 statistics are better than that of 2017”. Mr Geldenhuys believes that the improvement could be ascribed to an increased awareness and resulting preparedness amongst farmers, as well as cooperation with private security companies supporting farmers in their quest for a safer environment. “TAU SA wishes to convey it’s appreciation to members of the SAPS who have rendered excellent services, but there still is room for improvement, especially with reference to the identification and apprehension of murderers. Too few are arrested and the lack of successful prosecutions is cause for concern”, said Mr Geldenhuys. He also called upon farmers to improve the standard of security as well as the establishment of more farm watches under the auspices of organised agriculture to contribute to more favourable outcomes.
