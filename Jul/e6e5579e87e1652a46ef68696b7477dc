Statement on the abrupt closure of Afro Voice, formerly The New Age 1 July 2018 The South African Communist Party is shocked at the developments at Afro Voice, formerly The New Age newspaper. The SACP is particularly concerned about the jobs implications of the situation, and pledges its unwavering solidarity with the workers and the Communications Workers Union. The Party will look at the situation, consult with the union as well as the Congress of South African Trade Unions on the way forward, and will make a comprehensive statement at an appropriate time. The SACP is primarily deeply concerned by the persisting private monopoly and dominance in the media space and lack of diversity of content - particularly of progressive perspectives. The Party will therefore broaden consultation towards deepening its media transformation campaign. Issued by Alex MohubetswaneÂ Mahilo, National Spokesperson, SACP, 2 June 2018
