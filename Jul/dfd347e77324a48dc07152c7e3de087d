Reckless former Gauteng HOD appointed as Minister Susan Shabangu’s lieutenant The DA is deeply concerned by the appointment of former Gauteng Head of Department for Roads and Transport, Benedicta Monama, as a special advisor to the Minister of Social Development, Susan Shabangu. Monama has been strongly associated with suspicious activities and allegations of corruption. Monama’s position as HOD was not renewed in 2011 by then Premier, Nomvula Mokonyane, as it was found that she had approved a R3 million deal for the operating of licensing departments against the recommendation of Treasury not to do so. She further went on to have an equally disastrous tenure as the acting Municipal Manager of Limpopo’s Sekhukhune district municipality where she irregularly awarded 15 tenders worth R230 million. The department of Social Development has been embroiled in a myriad of scandals regarding the ability of the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) to guarantee the role-out of grants to 17 million South Africans. Should SASSA fail to deliver on its mandate of grant distribution, the lives of millions of South Africans will be put at risk. An agency that has the responsibility as great as that of SASSA, individuals such as Monama - who have a history of squandering public funds, should not be considered for this position. The DA will question Minister Shabangu as to her decision to appoint a person who is clearly not fit to handle the responsibilities of the position she now holds. The DA will ensure that the well-being of 17 million grant recipients is given the attention it deserves. Our people should not suffer due to the ineptitude of ANC deployees.
